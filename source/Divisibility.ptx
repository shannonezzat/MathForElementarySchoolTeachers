        <title>Intro to Divisibility</title>
        <p>
            Divisibility is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It describes one type of fundamental relationship between two integers, as we can think of a factor of a number being a "building block" of the number it is a factor of. Note that in this chapter, we will predominately study divisibility properties of whole numbers, but these can be easily extended to integers. From now on, unless otherwise stated, any number that appears is a whole number; that is, for all numbers <m>n</m> in this chapter,<m>n \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.</p>
        <p> Specifically, a number <m>a</m> is said to be divisible by another number <m>b</m> if there exists a number <m>c</m> such that <m>a = bc</m>. This is often expressed in various ways, such as "<m>b</m> is a factor of <m>a</m>", "<m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>", "<m>a</m> is a multiple of <m>b</m>", or "<m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>".
        </p>
        <example>
        <p> We know that <m>35=5 \times 7</m> , so we know that <m>5</m> divides <m>35</m>. We can also say <m>5</m> is a factor of <m>35</m>, <m>35</m> is a multiple of <m>5</m>, and <m>35</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>. These all express the same information. </p>
        <p> You've probably spotted that we can say the same things about <m>7</m> as we did about <m>35</m>. This idea gives us our first theorem, that we will state and prove more formally after we develop some notation for the concept of divisibility. </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            In mathematics, the "divides" symbol is represented as "|" and the "does not divide" symbol is represented as "∤". For example, if <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>, we write it as <m>b | a</m>. If <m>b</m> does not divide <m>a</m>, we write it as <m>b ∤ a</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at two examples. Consider the numbers 4 and 12. We can say that 4 divides 12, or in symbol form, <m>4 | 12</m>. This is because there exists an integer (3 in this case) such that <m>4 * 3 = 12</m>. Now consider the numbers 7 and 23. We can say that 7 does not divide 23, or in symbol form, <m>7 ∤ 23</m>. This is because there does not exist an integer such that <m>7 * c = 23</m>.

        <title>Transitivity And Divisibility</title>
        <p>We know that <m>3 \mid 12</m> since <m>12 =3 \times 4.</m> If there is another number <m>n</m> for which we know <m>12 \mid n</m>, do we need to check whether <m>3 \mid n</m>?</p>
        <p>
            We can use the fact that <m>3 \mid 12</m> to show that <m>3 \mid n</m>. We need to show that <m>n = 3 \times (   )</m> for some natural number in the brackets. Since <m>12 \mid n</m> we know there is some number <m>c</m> such that <m>n = 12c</m>. But since <m>12 = 3 \times 4 </m> we can rewrite this as <me>n=12c=(3\times 4) c</me> <me>
                =3\times (4c).
            </me>
            Since <m>4,c \in \mathbb{N}</m> we know <m>4 \times c \in \mathbb{N}</m>, so we were able to express <m>n</m> as <m>3</m> times another natural number, so <m>3 \mid n</m>.

        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we've shown this, we can use it to help up study divisibility of many numbers. We'll do many rules in the next subsection, but if we look at the example at the beginning of this section, we see that this shows the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            <theorem xml:id="thm-if12then3">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        If a number <m>n</m> is divisible by <m>12</m> then it is also divisible by <m>3</m>.  
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </theorem>
        <p>
            If you look at this closely, you can see that there is nothing special about <m>3</m> or <m>12</m> or <m>n</m>, except for the fact that there is a "chain" of divisibility relating them. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Let's try and show that this pattern always holds. The next exercise walks you through a proof of this fact.

                    Let's show that if we have three numbers <m>a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}</m> and we know that <m>a \mid b</m> and <m>b \mid c</m> then <m>a \mid c</m> as well.

                            How can we write <m>a \mid b</m> as an equation? You might want to introduce a new variable in it. Do something similar with <m>b \mid c</m>. <hint>
                                <p>
                                    A common mistake is to use the same variable to represent different quantities. Make sure you're using a different new symbol in both equations.

                            Assuming the two equations in the first part are true, we need to use the two equations above, plus some other mathematical rules, to show that the equation in the previous part must be true. Think if you can come up with a way of doing this. <hint>
                                <p>
                                    Think about substituting one equation into the other. Also, you'll need to use the idea of associativity of multiplication.
                                </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            This is a very useful result we've proved in the previous exercise. Let's state it as a theorem, so that we can refer to it later on:
        <theorem xml:id="thm-DivTrans">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>a,b,c \in 'mathbb{N}.</m> If <m>a \mid b</m> and <m>b \mid c</m> then <m>a \mid c</m>.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    See the previous exercise.

        </p>
        <p>
            We will talk about <term>relation</term> between two objects, like numbers, or polygons, or sets, or other things. Basically a relation between two objects is any statement involving two obects that is either TRUE or FALSE.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if our objects are sets, then <m>\in</m> is a relation between them. For example, let <m>A:=\{1,2\}, \quad B:=\{1,\{1,2\},3\}, \quad C:= \{1,2,3,4\}</m>. Under the relation <m>\in</m>, <m>A</m> is related to <m>B</m> since <m>A \in B</m>, but <m>A</m> is not related to <m>C</m> since <m>A \notin C</m>. Divisibility is also a relation. We can say that under divisibility <m>3</m> is related to <m>12</m> since <m>3 \mid 12</m> but <m>3</m> is not related to <m>10</m> since <m>3 \nmid 10</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This "chain"-like property of relations is incredibly important in mathematics. In fact, it comes up so often that we decided to give it it's own name. In fact, we've talked about this property before; equality has it as well, as we've seen in PROPERTIES OF EQUALITY. We'll talk about it in more generality here.

        <p>
            There are some special cases when considering divisibility. Firstly, any number is divisible by 1. This is because for any number <m>a</m>, <m>a = 1 * a</m>. Secondly, 0 is divisible by any number (except for 0 itself). This is because for any number <m>b ≠ 0</m>, <m>0 = b * 0</m>. However, 0 is not divisible by itself, as there is no number <m>c</m> such that <m>0 = 0 * c</m>. Lastly, any number <m>a</m> is divisible by itself, as <m>a = a * 1</m>.

                   Let's use the diagram above as a guide. Assuming the if-part is true, we assume <m>a \mid c</m>. This means that <m>c=ab</m> for some natural number <m>b</m>. We need to show that the then-part is true; that is, <m>nc=a(  )</m>, where the brackets contain some integer.

                   Since both <m>n</m> and <m>b</m> are natural numbers (we can write this as <m>n,b \in \mathbb{N}</m>), their product <m>nb \in \mathbb{N}</m>. Thus we've shown that the then-part must be true, and the theorem is proved.

        <title>Introduction</title>
        
    
    <p>
        In this section, we will introduce and prove the divisibility theorems for numbers 2 through 11. Each theorem will be introduced with an example, and then we will prove them for four-digit numbers. While we will focus on four-digit numbers for simplicity, it's important to note that these proofs can be extended to numbers of any number of digits.
    </p>
    <p>
        To facilitate our discussion, we will use underline notation in LaTeX to indicate a number by its place value digits. For example, a four-digit number <m>ABCD</m> can be represented as <m>\underline{ABCD} = A \times 1000 + B \times 100 + C \times 10 + D</m>. This notation will allow us to break down the number into its constituent parts and analyze its divisibility properties. Since we are using variables to represent unknown digits, we need this new notation, since if we write <m>ABCD</m> this usually means <m>A \times B \times C \times D</m>. However, if we write actual digits like <m>1234</m> without an underline, we still mean <m>1000+200+30+4</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In essence, the idea of divisibilty rules is to turn a question about divisibility of a large number into a question about divisibility of a smaller number. In some cases, that number will have a fixed number of digits, and in other cases the number of digits won't be fixed, but it will be a smaller number.

    <title>Divisibility Rules for 2, 4, and 8</title>
    <p>
        In number theory, divisibility rules are simple methods to determine whether one number is divisible by another without performing the division. This section will focus on the divisibility rules for 2, 4, and 8.

        <p>
            Most people reading this will know the divisilbity rule for <m>2</m>. It is one of the first patterns that elementary students notice, and of course it extends to being able to check if any number has 2 as a factor. The rule is as follows; we will prove it after showing examples of the rule showing both divisibility and non-divisibility.

               A reminder from the first chapter. Remember that an if-and-only-if statement, say <m>P</m> if-and-only-if <m>Q</m> is shorthand to mean "<m>P \to Q</m> and <m>Q \to P</m>". In fact, since the contrapositive of <m>Q \to P</m> is <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>, we can view <m>P</m> if-and-only-if <m>Q</m> as "<m>P \to Q</m> and <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>".

            A number is divisible by 2 if and only if the last digit is divisible by 2.

        </example>
        <p>
            Think about why we would only need to check the last digit of our number. It may be helpful to write <m>1234</m> as <m>1000+200+30+4</m> and <m>1235</m> as <m>1000+200+30+5</m>. Could you explain why this rule is true to another student?

        <p>
            Let's now prove this rule for four-digit numbers, using the notation mentioned in the introduction. We will rely on the divisibility theorems in the previous section to justify why this rule is true.

            The divisibility rule for 4 is very similar to the divisibility rule for 2. For the previous rule, we knew that <m>2</m> was a factor of every power of ten <m>10^e</m> with <m>e \geq 1</m>.

            Looking at the above rules, you may have started to notice a pattern emerging. We can view <m>2</m> as <m>2^1</m> and note that to check divisibility by 2 we only need to check whether the number formed by the last digit is divisibile by 2. For <m>4=2^2</m>, we need to check if the number formed by the last *two* digits is divisible by <m>4</m>. Let's check if the pattern has a chance of holding for <m>8=2^3:</m>

    <title>Divisibility Rule For 5</title>
    <p>
        The divisibility rule for 5 is also incredibly well known. Most people reading this should know that you only need to check whether the last digit of the number is either 5 or 0. However, like the divisibility rule for 2, it will be more advantageous to think the rule as the last digit being divisible by <m>5</m>. Note that the rule for divisibility by 2 relies on the fact that <m>10=2\times5</m>, since all multiples of <m>10</m>, including powers of <m>10</m>, are also divisbile by <m>2</m>. Since <m>10=2 \times 5,</m> the exact same idea should work for <m>5</m> as well as <m>2</m>. In fact, we should be able to write down the exact same argument for divisibility by 5 as divisibility by 2, with all the 2's replaced by 5:

    <title>Divisibility Rules For 3 And 9</title>
    
        
    
    <p>
        In the last section, we were able to develop divisibility rules for powers of <m>2</m> and <m>5</m> since powers of <m>10</m> are divisible by <m>2</m> and <m>5</m>. We could use this commonality between each power of <m>10</m>, and thus each place value in a number, to come up with a simplified rule for determining divisibility of these powers of <m>2</m> and <m>5</m>. In this section, we will look for another consistant commonality between powers of 10 being divided by <m>3</m> and <m>9</m> that will allow us to develop divisibility rules for these numbers. The next example will walk you through noticing the pattern.
    </p>
    <example>
        <p>
            In this example we will develop an intution for a divisibility rule for <m>3</m> and <m>9</m>.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Using long division, so you can keep track of remainders, find <m>10 \div 3</m>. Now do the same thing for <m>100, 1000, 10000,</m> and <m>100000</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    What commonality do you notice about these answers? In each division, how many of each power of 10 are you able to group into groups of 3? 
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Now do the division <m>111 \div 3</m> in two ways; using long division, and then doing the division separately for each place value; that is, <m>(100+10+1) \div 3 = 100\div 3 + 10 \div 3 + 1\div 3.</m> What can you say about the three remainders in the second case?

                <p>
                    Using the above as a guide, descibe a way to determine if a number is divisible by <m>3</m>.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Now redo the work above replacing <m>3</m> by <m>9</m>. You should notice the exact same pattern.

    <p>
        Now that we have developed our rule let's prove it for four-digit numbers. Like the other proofs in this section, this can be expanded to a proof for number with any amount of digits.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="divisibility-3-9">
        <title>Divisibility Rules for 3 and 9</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A number is divisible by <m>3</m> if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by <m>3</m>. Similarly, a number is divisible by <m>9</m> if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by <m>9</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Consider a number <m>\underline{abcd}</m> where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are its digits. We can express this number in its expanded form as:
            <me>
              \underline{abcd} = a \times 1000 + b \times 100 + c \times 10 + d
            </me>
            Using place value, we can rewrite this as:
            <me>
              \underline{abcd} = a \times (999 + 1) + b \times (99 + 1) + c \times (9 + 1) + d
            </me>
            Expanding and grouping, we get:
            <me>
              \underline{abcd} = a \times 999 + b \times 99 + c \times 9 + (a + b + c + d)
            </me>
            The terms <m>a \times 999</m>, <m>b \times 99</m>, and <m>c \times 9</m> are all divisible by <m>3</m> and <m>9</m> since <m>999</m>, <m>99</m>, and <m>9</m> are divisible by both <m>3</m> and <m>9</m>. Therefore, the divisibility of the number <m>\underline{abcd}</m> by <m>3</m> or <m>9</m> depends solely on the sum of its digits, <m>a + b + c + d</m>.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        Let's look at a few small examples to make sure we know how the rules work.

          </p>
        </statement>
      </example>
      <p>
        With smaller examples like the above, it might be difficult to see why these rules are very useful and powerful. Let's look at another, more difficult example:
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
            A student wrote down the following ten digit number: <m>1,435,3k7,451</m>, where <m>k</m> is some digit that was too messy in their notes to make it out. However, the student does know that the number is divisible by 3 but not divisibile by 9. What are the possible choices for the digit <m>k</m>?
        </p>
        <solution>
            <p>
                This would be a very hard problem using long division, and even using a calculator naively would require ten different trials, one for each digit. However, we can use the divisibility rules above to help us out.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know that the number is divisible by 3, so the sum of the digits must also be divisible by 3. The sum of the digits is <m>1+4+3+5+2+k+7+4+5+1=32+k</m>. We know that we can add either <m>1,4,</m> or <m>7</m> to <m>32</m> to get <m>33,36,</m> or <m>39</m>, which are multiples of <m>3</m>. But since the number isn't divisible by 9, we know that the sum cannot be divisible by 9, so it cannot be <m>36</m>. So <m>k \neq 4</m>. So the digit is either <m>1</m> or <m>7</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-DivisibilityRuleFor11">
    <title>Divisibility Rule For 11</title>
    <p>
        There is a nice divisibility rule for 11 that is similar to the divisibility rules for 3 and 9. The key of the divisibility rule for 3 and 9 was that for any <m>k \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>, it's true that <m>10^k \div 3</m> has a remainder of <m>1</m>. Let's explore dividing powers of <m>10</m> by <m>11</m> to see if we notice any patterns.
    </p>
    <exercise>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Let's start with <m>10^0=1</m>. What is the remainder of <m>10^0 \div 11</m>? It will be helpful to keep this information in a table.

            <li>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Make a conjecture about the patter of remainders of <m>10^k \div 11</m> for each <m>k \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Using the area and grouping model of division, draw a diagram that shows a few examples of this conjecture. Can you express the "large" remainders in terms of what is missing to obtain a full group of 11?
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </exercise>
    <p>
        Hopefully the exercise above gives you some intuition about what a divisibility rule for 11 will require. Note that there powers of 10, and therefore place values, fall into two groups; a remainder of 1 when <m>k</m> is even, and a remainder of 10 (or a "remainder" of -1) when <m>k</m> is odd. So when <m>k</m> is even, <m>11 \mid (10^k-1)</m>, and when <m>k</m> is odd <m>11 \mid (10^k+1)</m>. So we can express powers of 10 as numbers "close to" numbers divisible by 11, plus or minus 1. This is the key for this rule. Let's prove this now for six-digit numbers, just so we get a feel for the pattern that is happening. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <theorem xml:id="DivBy11">
            <title>Divisibility Rule for 11</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                A number is divisible by <m>11</m> if and only if the alternating sum of its digits (e.g., <m>A - B + C - D + E - F</m> for a six-digit number <m>\underline{ABCDEF}</m>) is divisible by <m>11</m>.
              </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
              <p>
                Let's prove this for a six-digit number, but the proof can be easily extended to a number of any number of digits. Consider a six-digit number <m>\underline{ABCDEF}</m> where <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, <m>D</m>, <m>E</m>, and <m>F</m> are its digits. We can express this number in its expanded form as:
                <me>
                  \underline{ABCDEF} = A \times 100000 + B \times 10000 + C \times 1000 + D \times 100 + E \times 10 + F
                </me>
                Using properties of powers of 10 and their relation to 11, we can rewrite this as:
                <me>
                  \underline{ABCDEF} = A \times (10^5 + 1) - A + B \times (10^4 - 1) + B + C \times (10^3 + 1) - C + D \times (10^2 - 1) + D + E \times 10 + F
                </me>
                Grouping the terms, we get:
                <me>
                  \underline{ABCDEF} = A \times 10^5 + B \times 10^4 + C \times 10^3 + D \times 10^2 + E \times 10 + F - (A - B + C - D + E - F)
                </me>
                The terms <m>A \times 10^5</m>, <m>B \times 10^4</m>, <m>C \times 10^3</m>, <m>D \times 10^2</m>, and <m>E \times 10</m> are all divisible by 11 due to the properties of powers of 10. Therefore, the divisibility of the number <m>\underline{ABCDEF}</m> by 11 depends solely on the alternating sum of its digits, <m>A - B + C - D + E - F</m>.

      Let's say you are interested in divisibility by some number <m>k</m>, and <m>k=a \times b</m>. This means that <m>a \mid k</m> and <m>b \mid k</m>. So if for some number <m>n</m> we know <m>k \mid n</m>, then by <xref ref="thm-DivTrans"/> we know that <m>a \mid n</m> and <m>b \mid n</m>. So we can say if <m>k \mid n</m> then <m>a \mid n</m> and <m>b \mid n</m>.

    <p>
       Does the converse of this hold as well? That is if we know <m>a \mid n</m> and <m>b \mid n</m> then do we know that <m>k \mid n</m>? Let's explore with some examples and see if we can determine the conditions when we can indeed combine divisibility rules to make a new divisibility rule.

Do you notice a pattern about  the numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> where <m>a \times b</m> is always a factor of numbers where both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are factors, and when there are numbers that do not have <m>a \times b</m> as a factor?

        <p>
            In the above example you probably have seen that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have no common factors, then <m>a \times b</m> is necessarily a factor of any number where both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are factors. Let's try and prove this.

                    <p>
                        Since this is a biconditional statement, we need to show that <m>P \to Q</m> and <m>Q \to P</m>. The direction <m>P \to Q</m> was already proved in the first paragraph of this subsection. So let's do the other direction.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's assume the "if-part" is true: let <m>a \mid n</m> and <m>b \mid n</m>. We need to show that the "then-part" is true, that is, <m>ab \mid n</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since we know <m>a \mid n</m> we know that <m>n=ar</m> for some natural number <m>r</m>. But we also know <m>b \mid n</m>, so since <m>n=ar</m> we know <m>b \mid ar</m>. Since <m>ar</m> has a factor of <m>b</m>, and <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> share no common factors, then all of the factors of <m>b</m> must be in <m>r</m>, so <m>r=bs</m> for some number <m>s</m>. So <m>n=ar = a(bs) = (ab)s</m>. So since we've written <m>n</m> as a multiple of <m>ab</m>, this means that <m>ab \mid n</m>.
                    </p>
                </proof>
            </theorem>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            To show that combining divisibility rules for numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> doesn't work if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have a common factor, let's try and develop a counterexample for each choice of two numbers with a common factor.

    <title>Iterative Divisibility Rules</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Sometimes, to determine if a number is divisible by another, we can use an iterative approach. This means applying the divisibility rule repeatedly until we get a number that we can easily determine its divisibility. This method is particularly useful for large numbers and for certain divisibility rules like those for 3, 9, and 11, which turn the problem of checcking divisibility of a large number into checking divisibility of a smaller number. 
      </p>
    </introduction>
  
    <p>
      Let's explore this iterative method with examples and non-examples for divisibility by 3, 9, and 11.
    </p>
  
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Divisibility by 3</title>
      <example>
        <p>
          To check if <m>3</m> divides <m>12345678901</m>, we sum its digits: <m>1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0+1 = 46</m>. Now, to check if <m>3</m> divides <m>46</m>, we sum its digits: <m>4+6 = 10</m>. Since 10 is not divisible by 3, neither is <m>12345678901</m>.
        </p>
      </example>
      <nonexample>
        <p>
          For <m>9876543210</m>, the sum of its digits is <m>45</m>, which is divisible by 3. Therefore <m>9876543210</m> is indeed divisible by 3.
        </p>
      </nonexample>
    </subsubsection>
  
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Divisibility by 9</title>
      <example>
        <p>
          To check if <m>9</m> divides <m>123456789012</m>, we sum its digits: <m>1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0+1+2 = 48</m>. Now, to check if <m>9</m> divides <m>48</m>, we sum its digits: <m>4+8 = 12</m>. Finally, summing the digits of 12 gives <m>3</m>, which is not divisible by 9. Thus, <m>123456789012</m> is not divisible by 9.
        </p>
      </example>
      <nonexample>
        <p>
          For <m>98765432109</m>, the sum of its digits is <m>54</m>, which is divisible by 9. Therefore <m>98765432109</m> is indeed divisible by 9.
        </p>
      </nonexample>
    </subsubsection>
  
    <subsubsection>
      <title>Divisibility by 11</title>
      <example>
        <p>
          To check if <m>11</m> divides <m>1234567890123</m>, we alternate the sum and subtraction of its digits: <m>1-2+3-4+5-6+7-8+9-0+1-2+3 = 17</m>. Since 17 is not divisible by 11, neither is <m>1234567890123</m>.
        </p>
      </example>
      <nonexample>
        <p>
          For <m>9090909090909090909090909040</m>, the alternating sum is <m>121</m>, and the alternating sum of <m>121</m> is <m>0</m>. Therefore <m>9090909090909090909090909040</m> is divisible by 11.

    <title>Prime Numbers</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Prime numbers are the multiplicative building blocks of all whole numbers. In fact, we will see that every whole number can be decomposed into a product of (maybe repeated) prime numbers in exactly one way. Let's define a prime number first:
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-PrimeNumber">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A <term>prime number</term> is a whole number that has exactly two factors; namely <m>1</m> and itself. If a natural number <m>n</m> is not prime, and not <m>1</m>, we say that <m>n</m> is <term>composite</term>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            It's worth noting here that using this definition, <m>1</m> is not a prime number. Most mathematicians decided to follow this convention since <m>1</m> behaves quite differently to other prime numbers, and therefore to avoid frequently talking about <m>1</m> as a special case for various results, it was more convenient to exclude <m>1</m> from the list of prime numbers. 
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                The number <m>7</m> is prime since the only numbers that are factors of <m>7</m> are <m>1</m> and <m>7</m> itself. Every other number does not divide evenly into 7.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number <m>6</m> is composite since <m>6=2 \times 3</m>, so both <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> are factors of <m>6</m>.
            </p>
        </example>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-FindingPrimeNumbers">
        <title>Finding Prime Numbers</title>
        <p>
            Let's try and come up with a list of all prime numbers less than <m>100</m>. We could do this for all primes below any number, but we choosse 100 for space reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's list all numbers up to 100, and we'll cross off any numbers that we determine are not prime (so are composite, or the number <m>1</m>).
        </p>
        <p>
            INSERT PIC OF NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 100
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll cross off <m>1</m> since we know that it doesn't have exactly two factors; its only factor is itself. So now we know that the next largest number, <m>2</m>, must be prime since it has <m>1</m> and itself as a factor, and there are no other numbers smaller than <m>2</m>. So we circle <m>2</m> and cross off all numbers that have <m>2</m> as a factor.
        </p>
        <p>
            INSERT UPDATED PIC
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we can go to the smallest number that remains, <m>3</m>, and circle that since it must be prime; 2 is not a factor and there are no smaller prime numbers. Like before we circle <m>3</m> and cross off all other multiples of <m>3</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
            INSERT UPDATED PIC
        </p>
        <p>
            We can continue this process until all numbers are either circled or crossed off. Before looking below, try this yourself and check that you get the same list of primes as below:
        </p>
        <p>
            INSERT UPDATED PIC
        </p>
        <p>
            This process is very old, and in fact is called the <term>sieve of Erotosthenes</term>, after the Greek mathematician Erotosthenes of Cyrene, of whom this method is attributed to.
        </p>
        <exercise>
            <p>
                We found a list of prime numbers less than 100. Let's see if we notice some patterns about primes by doing the same for numbers less than, say, 500.

            Looking at the sieve above, it looks like prime numbers get more "rare" the higher up we go. So a good question to ask is whether we eventually "run out" of prime numbers, or whether there are infinitely many. Let's explore this idea a little bit:
        </p>

                        By <xref ref="lem-PrimePlus1"/> we know that <m>2 \nmid 7</m> and <m>3 \nmid 7</m> (although this is pretty obvious anyway). So <m>a</m> is not divisible by any prime numbers in our set <m>A</m>. This means that <m>a</m> is either prime itself, or a product of other primes that aren't already in <m>A</m>. In this case <m>a=7</m> is prime.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We now redefine <m>A</m> to include our new prime (or primes if <m>a</m> had other prime factors.) So in this case now <m>A:=A \cup \{7\} = \{2,3\} \cup \{7\} = \{2,3,7\}</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We then repear the procedure with the new <m>A</m> to obtain <m>a=2\times 3\times 7+1 = 43</m>, which itself is prime, so we include it in our set as well; <m>A=\{2,3,7,43\}</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Let's do this again: now <m>a=2\times 3 \times 7 \times 43+1 = 1807</m>. You can check that <m>1807=13 \times 139</m> which are both prime, so we can add <m>13</m> and <m>39 </m> to our set: <m>A=\{2,3,7,13,39,43\}</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                    We can continue this process, and at each step we will form a number <m>a</m> that has no numbers in <m>A</m> as a factor, so we will be able to add at least one more prime number (either <m>a</m> itself if it is prime, or the prime factors of <m>a</m> if it is not) to our set.
                        
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        As our set grows by at least one number every iteration of this process, we know we can always include at least one more prime number in our set. So we will never run out of prime numbers, and thus there are infinitely many prime numbers.
                    </p>

        </example>
        <p>
            This exercise shows such an important result, that there are infinitely many prime numbers, that we should state this as a theorem:

                <statement>
                    <p>

            Some good questions come out of the previous exercise: first, will this list eventually include all prime numbers?  Secondly, if we have a large number (like <m>1807</m> or even bigger,) how can we determine if this number has any prime factors? The second question we will answer in the next subsection of this section.

        <p>
           Think about a number like <m>72</m>. We can factor <m>72</m> into the product of two numbers in many ways, and we will list them all now. 
        </p>
        <me>
            1 \times 72
        </me>
        <me>
            2 \times 36

        <me>

        <me>
            8 \times 9
        </me>
        <p>
            Later, we will be very careful and learn how to check that these are all of the possible ways of factoring 72 into two numbers. But it is not too hard to check in this case (do you see how to do this?) Let's plot these pairs on a number line to see if we notice something:
        </p>
        <p>
            INSERT PIC OF A NUMBER LINE WITH EACH PAIR OF FACTORS OF 72 PLOTTED
        </p>
        <p>
            It looks like the paris are approaching some point, let's call it <m>P</m> between 8 and 9, plotted above, and that there is always one number of the pair that's greater than <m>P</m>, and one that is less than <m>P</m>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's try the same process with another number, say <m>100</m>, and see if we can conjecture what this point <m>P</m> is mathematically:

                        Write down all possible factorizations of <m>100</m> into two factors. The factors do not have to be different numbers.

                        Can you determine the point <m>P</m> in this case? Can you give a mathematical meaning to this point, as it relates to <m>100</m>?

        <p>
            From the exercise above, factoring any number <m>n</m> into two factors, it looks like our factorizations approach the positive square root of <m>n</m> (usually written <m>\sqrt{n}</m>). In a later section we will explore square roots, and other roots, in more detail. The key observation here is that in any pair of factors of <m>n</m>, one factor is always greater than or equal to <m>\sqrt{n}</m> and the other factor is less than or equal to <m>\sqrt{n}</m>. Let's write this as a lemma:
        </p>
        <p>
            <lemma xml:id="lem-FactorizationSquareRoot">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m>. If <m>n=a\times b</m> for some <m>a,b \in \mathbb{N}</m> where, say, <m>a \geq b</m>, then <m>a \geq \sqrt{n}</m> and <m>b \leq \sqrt{n}</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                        We are going to show this result is true using a <term>proof by contradiction</term>. As in part 3 of <xref ref="subsec-JustifyingConditionalStatements"/>, we are going to pretend that there is a counterexample to our conditional statement (that is, the only situation where <m>P \to Q</m> is false; when <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.) We will show that if we are in this case, then mathematics "breaks" and we end up with something that is never true. This means that there are no counterexamples to our statement, so it must always be true. In our case, we will end up with showing that <m>n &gt; n</m>, which is always false; of course, no number is strictly greater than itself!. The idea will be that if we multiply two number bigger than <m>\sqrt{n}</m> together, we must get a number bigger than <m>n</m>.

                    <p>
                        Assuming that the if-part is true, let <m>n=ab</m> be a factorization of <m>n</m> into two factors, where <m>a \geq b</m>. Let's also assume that the then-part is false; that either both <ol>

                                    <m>a,b &gt; \sqrt{n}</m> or

                                    <m>a,b &lt; \sqrt{n}</m>.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>  There are two cases here. We will do the first case, and leave the second case as an exercise for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       By the definition of a square root, we can write <me>n = (\sqrt{n})(\sqrt{n})</me>. Since we're assuming <m>a &gt; \sqrt{n}</m>, if we replace one of the <m>\sqrt{n}</m> in the first expression with <m>a</m> we will obtain a larger product, so <me>n = (\sqrt{n})(\sqrt{n}) &gt; a(\sqrt{n}) </me>. Similarly, we're also assuming <m>b &gt; \sqrt{n}</m>, if we replace the other <m>\sqrt{n}</m> in the new expression with <m>b</m> we will obtain a larger product, so <me>n = (\sqrt{n})(\sqrt{n}) &gt; a(\sqrt{n}) &gt; ab </me>. But we know that <m>n=ab</m> so we can replace the <m>ab</m> on the right hand side by <m>n</m>. So <me>n = (\sqrt{n})(\sqrt{n}) &gt; a(\sqrt{n}) &gt; ab = n.</me> So if we look at the (in)equation above, we have just showed that <m>n &gt; n</m>. Since this is never true, then there are no counterexamples to our original statement (at least in the first case).

                       <p>
                        The case where we assume that <m>a,b &lt; \sqrt{n}</m> is very similar, and is left as an exercise to you. See if you can modify the case above to be a proof for this case.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Combining the two cases, we know that there are no counterexamples to our conditional statement, so it is always true.
                       </p>

                        
                    </p>
                    
                </proof>
            </lemma>
        </p>
        <p>
            We can use the idea above to help us, somewhat efficiently, determine if a number is composite. Indeed, if <m>n</m> is a composite number, it must have a pair of factors <m>1 &lt; a,b &lt; n</m> (and say that <m>a \geq b</m>) where <m>n=ab</m>, and by <xref ref="lem-FactorizationSquareRoot"/> it must be that <m>b \leq \sqrt{n}</m>; that is, every pair of factors of <m>n</m> has one of the factors that is no bigger than <m>\sqrt{n}</m>. So we can only worry about these factors, since the larger factors are paired with a smaller one.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can do even better than checking if all numbers less than <m>\sqrt{n}</m> are factors of <m>n</m>. We'll show that you only need to check whether the prime numbers less than <m>\sqrt{n}</m> are factors of <m>n</m>. First, we show that every composite number has at least one prime factor, and then we will show that the smallest non-unit (that is, not 1) factor of <m>n</m> is indeed a prime number.
        </p>
        <p>
            <theorem xml:id="thm-primefactorofcomposite">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        If <m>n \in \mathbb{N}</m> is composite then <m>n</m> has at least one prime factor.

                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the previous proof, let's show this by contradiction. We'll pretend we have a counterexample (in fact the smallest counterexample), and show that something "breaks", so thus there must be no counterexamples. The contradiction we'll have is that even though we picked the smallest counterexample, we'll find one that's smaller.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>n</m> be the smallest composite number (if-part true) that has no prime factors (then-part false). Since <m>n</m> is composite and has no prime factors, then <m>n=ab</m> for some composite numbers <m>a,b</m>. But all proper factors of a number are between <m>1</m> and <m>n</m> exclusive (that is <m>1 &lt; a,b &lt; n</m>). But since <m>n</m> has no prime factors, neither can <m>a</m> or <m>b</m>, since if <m>a=pc</m> for some prime number <m>c</m> then <m>n=ab=(pc)b=p(cb)</m>, and thus <m>p</m> is a factor of <m>n</m>. But this means that <m>a</m> is a smaller composite number than <m>n</m> with no prime factors, so <m>n</m> isn't the smallest counterexample, even though we picked it to be. This means that there is no smallest counterexample, and thus no counterexample to our statement. So <m>n</m> must have at least one prime factor.
                    </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            To show that the smallest factor of <m>n</m> is always a prime number, we do a very similar argument. We'll leave it as an exercise, but we state the theorem.

                        Left as an exercise. <hint>
                            <p>
                                If the smallest factor of <m>n</m> was composite, could you find an even smaller factor of <m>n</m>? 
                            </p>
                        </hint>

        </p>
        <p>
            Putting this all together, we know that if a number <m>n</m> is composite then there is a prime number <m>p \leq \sqrt{n}</m> such that <m>p \mid n.</m> So to check that <m>n</m> is composite, all we need to do is check if each prime number up to <m>\sqrt{n}</m> is a factor of <m>n</m>.
