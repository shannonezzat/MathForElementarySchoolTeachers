        <title>Intro to Divisibility</title>
        <p>
            Divisibility is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It describes one type of fundamental relationship between two integers, as we can think of a factor of a number being a "building block" of the number it is a factor of. Note that in this chapter, we will predominately study divisibility properties of whole numbers, but these can be easily extended to integers. From now on, unless otherwise stated, any number that appears is a whole number; that is, for all numbers <m>n</m> in this chapter,<m>n \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.</p>
        <p> Specifically, a number <m>a</m> is said to be divisible by another number <m>b</m> if there exists a number <m>c</m> such that <m>a = bc</m>. This is often expressed in various ways, such as "<m>b</m> is a factor of <m>a</m>", "<m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>", "<m>a</m> is a multiple of <m>b</m>", or "<m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>".
        </p>
        <example>
        <p> We know that <m>35=5 \times 7</m> , so we know that <m>5</m> divides <m>35</m>. We can also say <m>5</m> is a factor of <m>35</m>, <m>35</m> is a multiple of <m>5</m>, and <m>35</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>. These all express the same information. </p>
        <p> You've probably spotted that we can say the same things about <m>7</m> as we did about <m>35</m>. This idea gives us our first theorem, that we will state and prove more formally after we develop some notation for the concept of divisibility. </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            In mathematics, the "divides" symbol is represented as "|" and the "does not divide" symbol is represented as "∤". For example, if <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>, we write it as <m>b | a</m>. If <m>b</m> does not divide <m>a</m>, we write it as <m>b ∤ a</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at two examples. Consider the numbers 4 and 12. We can say that 4 divides 12, or in symbol form, <m>4 | 12</m>. This is because there exists an integer (3 in this case) such that <m>4 * 3 = 12</m>. Now consider the numbers 7 and 23. We can say that 7 does not divide 23, or in symbol form, <m>7 ∤ 23</m>. This is because there does not exist an integer such that <m>7 * c = 23</m>.

        <title>Divisibility Properties of 0, 1, and a Number with Itself</title>
        <p>
            There are some special cases when considering divisibility. Firstly, any number is divisible by 1. This is because for any number <m>a</m>, <m>a = 1 * a</m>. Secondly, 0 is divisible by any number (except for 0 itself). This is because for any number <m>b ≠ 0</m>, <m>0 = b * 0</m>. However, 0 is not divisible by itself, as there is no number <m>c</m> such that <m>0 = 0 * c</m>. Lastly, any number <m>a</m> is divisible by itself, as <m>a = a * 1</m>.

    <title>Divisibility Theorems</title>
    <p>
        In this section, we will discuss three important theorems related to divisibility. Each theorem will be introduced with an example for better understanding.
    </p>
    
    <subsubsection xml:id="theorem1">
        <title>Theorem 1</title>
        <p>
            If a number <m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>, then <m>a*n</m> is divisible by <m>b</m> for any natural number <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="example-theorem1">
            <title>Example for Theorem 1</title>
            <p>
                Let's consider <m>a = 6</m> and <m>b = 3</m>. Here, <m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>. Now, if we take any natural number, say <m>n = 4</m>, then <m>a*n = 24</m> is also divisible by <m>b</m>.
            </p>
        </example>
        <p>Lets try and prove this now. The idea is that if we know that <m>c</m> dots can be represented as a rectangle with dimensions <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, then we can "glue" <m>n</m> of these  together to make a larger rectangle with dimensions <m>a</m> and <m>nb</m>.

        <p> <theorem xml:id="thm-thm1">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    If a number <m>c</m> is divisible by <m>a</m>, then <m>nc</m> is divisible by <m>a</m> for any natural number <m>n</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                   Let's use the diagram above as a guide. Assuming the if-part is true, we assume <m>a \mid c</m>. This means that <m>c=ab</m> for some natural number <m>b</m>. We need to show that the then-part is true; that is, <m>nc=a(  )</m>, where the brackets contain some integer. Noting that the LHS of the second equation is the LHS of the first equation multiplied ny <m>n</m>, let's multiply the first equation by <m>n</m>: <me>
                    
                  n \times (c) = n \times (ab).
                   
                    
                   </me>
                   Using commutativity and associativity:
                   <me>
                    nc = a(nb).
                   </me>
                   Since both <m>n</m> and <m>b</m> are natural numbers (we can write this as <m>n,b \in \mathbb{N}</m>), their product <m>nb \in \mathbb{N}</m>. Thus we've shown that the then-part must be true, and the theorem is proved.

        <title>Theorem 2</title>
        <p>
            If a number <m>a</m> is divisible by <m>c</m> and a number <m>b</m> is divisible by <m>c</m>, then <m>a+b</m> and <m>a-b</m> are also divisible by <m>c</m>.

        <example xml:id="example-theorem2">
            <title>Example for Theorem 2</title>
            <p>
                Let's consider <m>a = 10</m>, <m>b = 20</m>, and <m>c = 5</m>. Here, both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are divisible by <m>c</m>. Therefore, <m>a+b = 30</m> and <m>a-b = -10</m> are also divisible by <m>c</m>.
            </p>
        </example>
        <p>Let's try and prove this. It's similar to Theorem 1, and in fact, Theorem 1 can be looked at as a repeated application of Theorem 2. Let's say we know that <m>a</m> is a factor of both <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>. Then we can express both <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> dots as a rectangle, with one of the dimensions being <m>a</m>, and the other we'll call <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, respectively. Then in the addition case, we can "glue" the two rectangles together to make a rectangle with dimensions <m>a</m> and <m>b+c</m>. INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>

                <p>
                    We'll only prove the case for addition, and leave the case for subtraction as an exercise later. Assuming the if-part is true, assume that <m>b=ax</m> and <m>c=ay</m> for some natural numbers <m>x,y</m>. We need to show that <m>b+c=a(   )</m> where the bracket is some natural numbber.

                        b+c=ax+ay.

                    Since <m>x,y \in \mathbb{N}</m> we know their sum <m>x+y \in \mathbb{N}</m> too. Thus we have shown the then-part must be true and the theorem is proved.

        <p>
            Like the other two theorems, let's try and get an idea for a proof via a diagram first. This is a good opportunity for you to try to come up with a diagram that shows this situation before looking below. Try and draw this result, at least for the additive case, and then check if your idea is close to the picture hidden below:

          It looks like when you "glue" the two rectangle-like objects together, the remainder that doesn't make a full row in the non-divisible number is still there when the ojects are added. This is essentially the entire idea.

                        Again, we do the additive case, and leave the subtraction case to an exercise later. Let <m>a \mid b</m> and <m>a \nmid c</m>. This means that <m>b=ax</m> for some natural number <m>x</m>, and <m>c=ay+r</m>, where <m>y</m> is a natural number, and thinking about it as a remainder, <m>r</m> is a natural number such that <m>r \leq a-1</m>. We need to show that <m>a \nmid b+c</m>, so we need to show that <m>b+c</m> has a remainder. Adding both equations together, we get

                        Factoring out an <m>a</m> from the first two terms on the RHS,

        In this section, we will introduce and prove the divisibility theorems for numbers 2 through 11. Each theorem will be introduced with an example, and then we will prove them for four-digit numbers. While we will focus on four-digit numbers for simplicity, it's important to note that these proofs can be extended to numbers of any number of digits.
    </p>
    <p>
        To facilitate our discussion, we will use underline notation in LaTeX to indicate a number by its place value digits. For example, a four-digit number <m>ABCD</m> can be represented as <m>\underline{ABCD} = A \times 1000 + B \times 100 + C \times 10 + D</m>. This notation will allow us to break down the number into its constituent parts and analyze its divisibility properties. Since we are using variables to represent unknown digits, we need this new notation, since if we write <m>ABCD</m> this usually means <m>A \times B \times C \times D</m>. However, if we write actual digits like <m>1234</m> without an underline, we still mean <m>1000+200+30+4</m>.

It is one of the first patterns that elementary students notice, and of course it extends to being able to check if any number has 2 as a factor. The rule is as follows; we will prove it after showing examples of the rule showing both divisibility and non-divisibility.

               A reminder from the first chapter. Remember that an if-and-only-if statement, say <m>P</m> if-and-only-if <m>Q</m> is shorthand to mean "<m>P \to Q</m> and <m>Q \to P</m>". In fact, since the contrapositive of <m>Q \to P</m> is <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>, we can view <m>P</m> if-and-only-if <m>Q</m> as "<m>P \to Q</m> and <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>".

            A number is divisible by 2 if and only if the last digit is divisible by 2.

            <p>
                Consider the number 1234. The last digit is 4, which is even. Therefore, 1234 is divisible by 2.

                        Consider the four-digit number <m>\underline{ABCD}=A\times 1000+B\times 100+C\times 10+D</m>. We know that <m>2 \mid 1000</m>, <m>2 \mid 100</m>, and <m>2 \mid 10</m>, so by <xref ref="theorem1"/> we know that <m>2 \mid A\times 1000,</m> <m>2 \mid B\times 100</m>, and <m>2 \mid C \times 10</m>. By <xref ref="theorem2"/> we know that <m>2 \mid (A\times 1000+B\times 100+C\times 10).\</m>. For ease, let's define <m>S:=A\times 1000+B\times 100+C\times 10</m>. Thus we can write <m>\underline{ABCD}=S+D</m>.

                    <p>
                        Now with that setup we can start proving <m>P \to Q</m> and <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>. By <xref ref="theorem2"/> we know that if <m>2 \mid D</m> (P being true) then <m>2 \mid S+D</m>, so Q is true. So we have that <m>P \to Q</m> is always true. By <xref ref="theorem3"/> if <m>2 \nmid D</m> (P being false) then <m>2 \nmid S+D</m>, so Q is false. So we have that <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m> is always true.

        <title>Divisibility Rule for 4</title>
        <p>
            The divisibility rule for 4 is very similar to the divisibility rule for 2. For the previous rule, we knew that <m>2</m> was a factor of every power of ten <m>10^e</m> with <m>e \geq 1</m>. It is a good idea to see if you can modify the work from the divisbility rule for 2 to develop a divisibility rule for 4. Try this yourself before reading on. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, we state the rule and give some examples and non-examples before we prove that the rule always works.
