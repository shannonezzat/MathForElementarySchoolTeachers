        <title>Intro to Divisibility</title>
        <p>
            Divisibility is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It describes one type of fundamental relationship between two integers, as we can think of a factor of a number being a "building block" of the number it is a factor of. Note that in this chapter, we will predominately study divisibility properties of whole numbers, but these can be easily extended to integers. From now on, unless otherwise stated, any number that appears is a whole number; that is, for all numbers <m>n</m> in this chapter,<m>n \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.</p>
        <p> Specifically, a number <m>a</m> is said to be divisible by another number <m>b</m> if there exists a number <m>c</m> such that <m>a = bc</m>. This is often expressed in various ways, such as "<m>b</m> is a factor of <m>a</m>", "<m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>", "<m>a</m> is a multiple of <m>b</m>", or "<m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>".
        </p>
        <example>
        <p> We know that <m>35=5 \times 7</m> , so we know that <m>5</m> divides <m>35</m>. We can also say <m>5</m> is a factor of <m>35</m>, <m>35</m> is a multiple of <m>5</m>, and <m>35</m> is divisible by <m>5</m>. These all express the same information. </p>
        <p> You've probably spotted that we can say the same things about <m>7</m> as we did about <m>35</m>. This idea gives us our first theorem, that we will state and prove more formally after we develop some notation for the concept of divisibility. </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            In mathematics, the "divides" symbol is represented as "|" and the "does not divide" symbol is represented as "∤". For example, if <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>, we write it as <m>b | a</m>. If <m>b</m> does not divide <m>a</m>, we write it as <m>b ∤ a</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look at two examples. Consider the numbers 4 and 12. We can say that 4 divides 12, or in symbol form, <m>4 | 12</m>. This is because there exists an integer (3 in this case) such that <m>4 * 3 = 12</m>. Now consider the numbers 7 and 23. We can say that 7 does not divide 23, or in symbol form, <m>7 ∤ 23</m>. This is because there does not exist an integer such that <m>7 * c = 23</m>.
        </p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-TransitivityAndDivisibility">
        <title>Transitivity And Divisibility</title>
        <p>We know that <m>3 \mid 12</m> since <m>12 =3 \times 4.</m> If there is another number <m>n</m> for which we know <m>12 \mid n</m>, do we need to check whether <m>3 \mid n</m>?</p>
        <p>
            We can use the fact that <m>3 \mid 12</m> to show that <m>3 \mid n</m>. We need to show that <m>n = 3 \times (   )</m> for some natural number in the brackets. Since <m>12 \mid n</m> we know there is some number <m>c</m> such that <m>n = 12c</m>. But since <m>12 = 3 \times 4 </m> we can rewrite this as <me>n=12c=(3\times 4) c</me> <me>
                =3\times (4c).
            </me>
            Since <m>4,c \in \mathbb{N}</m> we know <m>4 \times c \in \mathbb{N}</m>, so we were able to express <m>n</m> as <m>3</m> times another natural number, so <m>3 \mid n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look at this closely, you can see that there is nothing special about <m>3</m> or <m>12</m> or <m>n</m>, except for the fact that there is a "chain" of divisibility relating them. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Let's try and show that this patter always holds. The next exercise walks you through a proof of this fact. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <exercise>
                <p>
                    Let's show that if we have three numbers <m>a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}</m> and we know that <m>a \mid b</m> and <m>b \mid c</m> then <m>a \mid c</m> as well.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            How can we write <m>a \mid b</m> as an equation? You might want to introduce a new variable in it. Do something similar with <m>b \mid c</m>. <hint>
                                <p>
                                    A common mistake is to use the same variable to represent different quantities. Make sure you're using a different new symbol in both equations. 
                                </p>
                            </hint>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We want to show that <m>a \mid c</m>. Write this as an equation.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Assuming the two equations in the first part are true, we need to use the two equations above, plus some other mathematical rules, to show that the equation in the previous part must be true. Think if you can come up with a way of doing this. <hint>
                                <p>
                                    Think about substituting one equation into the other. Also, you'll need to use the idea of associativity of multiplication.
                                </p>
                            </hint>

                </ol>
            </exercise>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we've shown this, we can use it to help up study divisibility of many numbers. We'll do many rules in the next subsection, but if we look at the example at the beginning of this section, we see that this shows the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            <theorem xml:id="thm-if12then3">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        If a number <m>n</m> is divisible by <m>12</m> then it is also divisible by <m>3</m>.  
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </theorem>
                       
        </p>
        <p>
            We will talk about <term>relationships</term> between two objects, like numbers, or polygons, or sets, or other things. Basically a relationship between two objects is any statement involving two obects that is either TRUE or FALSE.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if our objects are sets, then <m>\in</m> is a relation between them. For example, let <m>A:=\{1,2\}, \quad B:=\{1,\{1,2\},3\}, \quad C:= \{1,2,3,4\}</m>. Under the relation <m>\in</m>, <m>A</m> is related to <m>B</m> since <m>A \in B</m>, but <m>A</m> is not related to <m>C</m> since <m>A \notin C</m>. Divisibility is also a relation. We can say that under divisibility <m>3</m> is related to <m>12</m> since <m>3 \mid 12</m> but <m>3</m> is not related to <m>10</m> since <m>3 \nmid 10</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This "chain"-like property of relationships is incredibly important in mathematics. In fact, it comes up so often that we decided to give it it's own name. In fact, we've talked about this property before; equality has it as well, as we've seen in <xref ref="assemblage-PropertiesOfEquality"/>. We'll talk about it in more generality here.

                   Let <m>\tilde</m> be some relationship (such as equality "=", or divisibility "\mid")  between objects (such as numbers).

        <title>Divisibility Properties of 0, 1, and a Number with Itself</title>
        <p>
            There are some special cases when considering divisibility. Firstly, any number is divisible by 1. This is because for any number <m>a</m>, <m>a = 1 * a</m>. Secondly, 0 is divisible by any number (except for 0 itself). This is because for any number <m>b ≠ 0</m>, <m>0 = b * 0</m>. However, 0 is not divisible by itself, as there is no number <m>c</m> such that <m>0 = 0 * c</m>. Lastly, any number <m>a</m> is divisible by itself, as <m>a = a * 1</m>.

        In this section, we will discuss three important theorems related to divisibility. Each theorem will be introduced with an example for better understanding.

    <subsubsection xml:id="theorem1">
        <title>Theorem 1</title>
        <p>
            If a number <m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>, then <m>a*n</m> is divisible by <m>b</m> for any natural number <m>n</m>.

                Let's consider <m>a = 6</m> and <m>b = 3</m>. Here, <m>a</m> is divisible by <m>b</m>. Now, if we take any natural number, say <m>n = 4</m>, then <m>a*n = 24</m> is also divisible by <m>b</m>.

        <p>Lets try and prove this now. The idea is that if we know that <m>c</m> dots can be represented as a rectangle with dimensions <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, then we can "glue" <m>n</m> of these  together to make a larger rectangle with dimensions <m>a</m> and <m>nb</m>.

                <p>
                   Let's use the diagram above as a guide. Assuming the if-part is true, we assume <m>a \mid c</m>. This means that <m>c=ab</m> for some natural number <m>b</m>. We need to show that the then-part is true; that is, <m>nc=a(  )</m>, where the brackets contain some integer. Noting that the LHS of the second equation is the LHS of the first equation multiplied ny <m>n</m>, let's multiply the first equation by <m>n</m>: <me>

                    nc = a(nb).
                   </me>
                   Since both <m>n</m> and <m>b</m> are natural numbers (we can write this as <m>n,b \in \mathbb{N}</m>), their product <m>nb \in \mathbb{N}</m>. Thus we've shown that the then-part must be true, and the theorem is proved.

        <p>Let's try and prove this. It's similar to Theorem 1, and in fact, Theorem 1 can be looked at as a repeated application of Theorem 2. Let's say we know that <m>a</m> is a factor of both <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>.

                        Again, we do the additive case, and leave the subtraction case to an exercise later. Let <m>a \mid b</m> and <m>a \nmid c</m>. This means that <m>b=ax</m> for some natural number <m>x</m>, and <m>c=ay+r</m>, where <m>y</m> is a natural number, and thinking about it as a remainder, <m>r</m> is a natural number such that <m>r \leq a-1</m>.

            If you look at the previous two theorems, you'll see that they cover when <m>a</m> divides both numbers <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>, and when <m>a</m> divides exactly one of these and not the other. A natural question we can ask is "what happens if <m>a</m> divides neither <m>b</m> nor <m>c</m>?"

    <p>
        In this section, we will introduce and prove the divisibility theorems for numbers 2 through 11. Each theorem will be introduced with an example, and then we will prove them for four-digit numbers. While we will focus on four-digit numbers for simplicity, it's important to note that these proofs can be extended to numbers of any number of digits.
    </p>
    <p>
        To facilitate our discussion, we will use underline notation in LaTeX to indicate a number by its place value digits. For example, a four-digit number <m>ABCD</m> can be represented as <m>\underline{ABCD} = A \times 1000 + B \times 100 + C \times 10 + D</m>. This notation will allow us to break down the number into its constituent parts and analyze its divisibility properties. Since we are using variables to represent unknown digits, we need this new notation, since if we write <m>ABCD</m> this usually means <m>A \times B \times C \times D</m>. However, if we write actual digits like <m>1234</m> without an underline, we still mean <m>1000+200+30+4</m>.

    <title>Divisibility Rules for 2, 4, and 8</title>
    <p>
        In number theory, divisibility rules are simple methods to determine whether one number is divisible by another without performing the division. This section will focus on the divisibility rules for 2, 4, and 8.
    </p>
    <subsubsection xml:id="divisibility-rule-2">
        <title>Divisibility Rule for 2</title>
        <p>
            Most people reading this will know the divisilbity rule for <m>2</m>. It is one of the first patterns that elementary students notice, and of course it extends to being able to check if any number has 2 as a factor. The rule is as follows; we will prove it after showing examples of the rule showing both divisibility and non-divisibility.

               A reminder from the first chapter. Remember that an if-and-only-if statement, say <m>P</m> if-and-only-if <m>Q</m> is shorthand to mean "<m>P \to Q</m> and <m>Q \to P</m>". In fact, since the contrapositive of <m>Q \to P</m> is <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>, we can view <m>P</m> if-and-only-if <m>Q</m> as "<m>P \to Q</m> and <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>".
            </p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>
            A number is divisible by 2 if and only if the last digit is divisible by 2. 
        </p>
        <example xml:id="example-divisibility-2">
            <title>Example</title>
            <p>
                Consider the number 1234. The last digit is 4, which is even. Therefore, 1234 is divisible by 2.
            </p>

        <example xml:id="non-example-divisibility-2">

            <p>
                Consider the number 1235. The last digit is 5, which is not even. Therefore, 1235 is not divisible by 2.
            </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            Think about why we would only need to check the last digit of our number. It may be helpful to write <m>1234</m> as <m>1000+200+30+4</m> and <m>1235</m> as <m>1000+200+30+5</m>. Could you explain why this rule is true to another student? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's now prove this rule for four-digit numbers, using the notation mentioned in the introduction. We will rely on the divisibility theorems in the previous section to justify why this rule is true.

                <proof>
                    <p>
                        Consider the four-digit number <m>\underline{ABCD}=A\times 1000+B\times 100+C\times 10+D</m>. We know that <m>2 \mid 1000</m>, <m>2 \mid 100</m>, and <m>2 \mid 10</m>, so by <xref ref="theorem1"/> we know that <m>2 \mid A\times 1000,</m> <m>2 \mid B\times 100</m>, and <m>2 \mid C \times 10</m>. By <xref ref="theorem2"/> we know that <m>2 \mid (A\times 1000+B\times 100+C\times 10).\</m>. For ease, let's define <m>S:=A\times 1000+B\times 100+C\times 10</m>. Thus we can write <m>\underline{ABCD}=S+D</m>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now with that setup we can start proving <m>P \to Q</m> and <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m>. By <xref ref="theorem2"/> we know that if <m>2 \mid D</m> (P being true) then <m>2 \mid S+D</m>, so Q is true. So we have that <m>P \to Q</m> is always true. By <xref ref="theorem3"/> if <m>2 \nmid D</m> (P being false) then <m>2 \nmid S+D</m>, so Q is false. So we have that <m>\sim P \to \sim Q</m> is always true.

        <title>Divisibility Rule for 4</title>
        <p>
            The divisibility rule for 4 is very similar to the divisibility rule for 2. For the previous rule, we knew that <m>2</m> was a factor of every power of ten <m>10^e</m> with <m>e \geq 1</m>. It is a good idea to see if you can modify the work from the divisbility rule for 2 to develop a divisibility rule for 4. Try this yourself before reading on.

        <title>Divisibility Rule for 8</title>
        <p>
            Looking at the above rules, you may have started to notice a pattern emerging. We can view <m>2</m> as <m>2^1</m> and note that to check divisibility by 2 we only need to check whether the number formed by the last digit is divisibile by 2. For <m>4=2^2</m>, we need to check if the number formed by the last *two* digits is divisible by <m>4</m>. Let's check if the pattern has a chance of holding for <m>8=2^3:</m>
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                <p>
                    Consider the number 1232. The number formed by the last three digits is 232. We can check that <m>232 \div 8 = 29</m>, and <m>1232 \div 8 = 154</m>. So it looks like the expected rule holds, at least for this example. Indeed, since 232 is divisible by 8, 1232 is also divisible by 8.
