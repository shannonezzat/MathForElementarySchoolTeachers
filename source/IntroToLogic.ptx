      When we say sentences like "I will have a coffee or a donut" or "If a number is even and divisible by three then it is divisible by six" we want to make sure we all agree on the precise meaning of the sentence. In this section, we will:    </p>

     introduce the topic of logical statements </li>
    <li> give precise meaning to common english words like "and", "or", "all", "some" "if", and "then"</li>
    <li> determine exactly when logical statements are true (and when they are false) and how to show this</li>
    <li> introduce various related statements to "if-then" statements.

    One of the most important aspects of mathematics is communication. As much as it's important to solve problems and master arithmetic and algebraic skills, it's just as important to be able to communicate your answers (or questions) to others so that everyone has the same understanding of what is being said mathematically. 
</p>

<p>
    In mathematics we really care about the truth of sentences that we write or say.   We introduce the following concepts:
</p>

<definition>
A <term> statement </term> is a sentence that is either always true or always false (but not both).
<example>
    <p>"Ottawa is the capital of Canada" is a true statement. </p> <p>"<m>4^2=10</m>" is a false statement.</p>
</example>
<example><title>Non-Examples</title>


    "What time is it?" is a sentence that is not a statement. It is simply a question and cannot be given a truth value of true or false. Similarly, "Go do you homework" is a command, and not a statement.
</example>
</definition>

<p>
    Sometimes we want sentences to have a variable in them so that when we fill in the variable with a value it becomes a statement.
</p>

<definition>    
An <term> open sentence </term> is a sentence with a variable such that the sentence becomes a statement when you fill in a value into the variable.
<example>
    <p>
        "<m>X^2 = 1</m>" is an open sentence. It is true when <m>x=1</m> or <m>x=-1</m> and false for any other numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Winnipeg is the capital city of Canadian province P" is an open sentence. It is true when P = "Manitoba" and false for all other Canadian provinces.
    </p>
    
</example>

          <li>
              <p>
                  In open sentences, we usually restrict the allowable inputs for variables. The set of allowable inputs is called the <term>domain</term>. In the first example above, it's implicit that we only want <m>X</m> to be a number, and not, say, a colour, or telephone, or anything else! If it's not enitrely clear what the domiain of an open sentence is, we should tell people what the domain is.  
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  We want statements to have exactly one truth value; either True(T) or False(F). If we know a sentence is a statement and it's not true, it must be false. The easiest way to think about this is by asking yourself "am I being lied to?" If the answer is no, then the statement is true (even if it doesn't really apply or make sense).

    <title>And, Or, and Not</title>
    


<p>
    In the English language, there is a lot of ambiguity in the words that we say. Consider the following two sentences:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Your hamburger combo comes with fries or onion rings.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                You can check a free bag if you are have elite status or you purchased a business class ticket.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    In both of these examples, the word "or" has a different meaning. In the first, "or" is used exclusively; you can have fries or onion rings but not both. In the second, it is used inclusively; you would expect that you would get to check a free bag if you had elite status and a business class ticket.
</p>

<p>
    In mathematics, we aim to be as precise as possible with our language. We want to make sure that everyone understands the exact same ideas when we express ourselves, especially in determining when a statement is true or false. The mathematical community has agreed upon precise meanings for words such as "and", "or", "not", "all", "some", and "if-then" (among others). Let's learn about them now. In the following definition we use <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> as variables to mean any two statements:
</p>
<definition>
<p>If <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are statements, then:
    <ol>
        <li> the statement "<m>P</m> <term>and</term> <m>Q</m>" is true exactly when <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is true. Otherwise it is false.</li>
        <li> the statement "<m>P</m> <term>or</term> <m>Q</m>" is false exactly when <m>P</m> is false and <m>Q</m> is false. Otherwise it is true. </li>
    </ol>
</p>
</definition>
<exercise>
   <p> Let <m>P :=</m> "I will have a donair for dinner" and <m>Q :=</m> "I will have pizza for dinner". Determine if the statements "<m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>" and "<m>P</m> or <m>Q</m>" are true when: </p>

<definition>
<p>
    If <m>P</m> is a statement, then the <term>negation</term> of <m>P</m>, written <m>\sim P</m> is a statment with the opposite truth value of <m>P</m> (but with the same context). If <m>P</m> is an open sentence, then <m>\sim P</m> is an open sentence with the opposite truth value for each variable input.

</p>
<example>
    If <m>P:=</m> "2 is a prime number" (which is true) then <m>\sim P = </m> "2 is not a prime number" (which is false).
</example>
<example>
    If <m>P = "x &lt; 5"</m> over the domain of counting numbers (which is true when <m>= 1,2,3,4</m> and false otherwise) then <m>\sim P = "x \geq 5"</m> (which is false when <m>x=1,2,3,4</m> and true otherwise). You could also write <m>\sim P</m> as <m>"x > 4"</m>, or in many other logically equivalent ways.

</example>
</definition>
<exercise>
    <p>
        If <m>P = "x &lt; 5"</m> over the domain of counting numbers, explain why <m>x &gt; 5</m> isn't the negation of <m>P</m>.
    </p>
    <solution>
        <p>
           When <m>x = 5</m>, <m>P</m> is false, since 5 is not less than 5. However <m>x &gt; 5</m> is also false when <m>x=5</m> since 5 is not greater than 5.  Since these open sentences do not have opposite truth values for every possible input, one cannot be the negation of the other.
        </p>
    </solution>
</exercise>
<p>
    We can write down more complex expressions using combinations of "and", "or", and "not". To help us determine when these complex statements are true, we can use a <term>truth table</term> to look at these compound statements piece by piece:
</p>

<definition>
<p>
    If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two (usually compound) statements, we say that they are <term>logically equivalent</term> when their truth values always agree given the truth values of the constituent parts.
</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-Quantifiers">
    <title>Quantified Statements</title>
    

When we talk about mathematical ideas, we want to express how many objects they apply to. We do this by using quantifiers:
<definition>
<p>
    Universal quantifiers are words that signify every object in our domain (that is, every object under consideration). These are words like "all", "for all", "every", "no", "none", and "each".
</p>

<p>
    Existential quantifiers are words that signify at least one object in our domain. These are words and phrases like "there is", "some", "at least one", and "there exists".
</p>

<example>
    <p>
        Some universally quantified statements are:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    All cats are mammals
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Each whole number is odd
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    No polygons have exactly two sides
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Every whole number has a non-negative square
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        Some existentially quantified statements are:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    There is an odd integer
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Some cats are grey
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    At least one fraction is equal to 1
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    There exists a prime number with a factor of 6
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</example>
</definition>

<p>You may have noticed that these quantified statements are a combination of a quantifier (universal or existental) and an open sentence, thought sometimes when written in English the variable can be hidden. For example, "there is an odd integer" can be reworded to "there is an integer <m>x</m> such that <m>x</m> is odd." </p>

<exercise>
    <p>
        In the two examples above, write the quantified statement using a combination of a quantifier (use only "For All" or "There is") and an open sentence. Make sure to include a variable. Then, determine the truth value of the quantified statement.
    </p>
    <solution>
        <p>
            You may have a different wording, but one choice would be:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                       For all cats <m>C</m>, <m>C</m> is a mammal (T)

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        For all whole numbers <m>n</m>, <m>n</m> is odd (F)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        For all polygons <m>p</m>, <m>p</m> does not have exactly two sides (T)                       , , 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        For all whole numbers <m>n</m>, <m>n^2 \geq 0</m> (T)
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Note that, for 3, we changed "No <m>p</m> are <m>Q</m>", where <m>Q</m> was an open sentence, to "All <m>p</m> are <m>\sim Q</m>". 
        </p>
    </solution>
    <solution>
        <p>
            You may have a slighly different wording, but one choice would be:

                    <p>
                        There is an integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n</m> is odd. (T)
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        There is a cat <m>C</m> such that <m>C</m> is grey. (T)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is a fraction <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> such that <m>\frac{a}{b} =1</m> (T)

                </li>
            </ol>
            Later in this chapter we will learn how to write "is an odd number" and "is divisible by 6" more mathematically, using algebra.

            <li>
                <p>
                    A universally quantified statement can be <term>vacuously true</term> if there are no objects that apply to the statement. For example, "all unicorns are named George" is not lying to you since you can't find a unicorn not named George, so we consider statements like this true.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Other than vacuously true statements, if a universally quantified statement is true so is the "extentially" quantified version. For example, "all polygons have at least three sides" is true, so "some polygons have at least three sides" is true too! Remember, existential quantifiers only care of an object exists, not how many. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

<p>
    We can negate quantified statements as well. We do this regularly in our daily lives, but let's try and pinpoint what is going on:

</p>

<exercise>
   <p> A friend tells you that all cats are blue. This is obviously a false statement! Suppose you wanted to reply to your friend with the correct  negated (true) statement. Which of the following could you reply with? </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some cats are blue
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some cats are not blue
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                All cats are not blue
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                There is a cat that isn't blue
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                No cats are blue
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <solution>
        <p>
            Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Be careful with statements 3 and 5; the reason we know not all cats are blue is that we've seen cats that are not blue. There may be a cat out there that is blue that we've never seen, so we can't say for sure that no cats are blue.
        </p>
    </solution>
</exercise>

<exercise>
    <p> A friend tells you that some cats have wings. This, like the exercise above, is obviously a false statement! Suppose you wanted to reply to your friend with the correct negated (true) statement. Which of the following could you reply with? </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                All cats have wings

        </li>
        <li>

    <solution>
        <p>
            Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Note the form of these two statements: statement 2 is "No P are Q" and statement 4 is "All P are not Q". As mentioned above, these are logically equivalent.
        </p>
    </solution>
</exercise>

<p> Note that in the previous two exercises, there was a pattern to negating a quantified statement. In general, this holds for negating any quantified statement. </p>
<p>
    To negate a quantified statement of the type "All P are Q" or "Some P are Q":
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Switch the type of quantifier to the other
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Negate the open sentence part of the quantified statement.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

</p>
<p>
    Remember that you can rewrite "No P are Q" as "All P are not Q". Using this, you can negate "No P are Q" to "Some P are Q" (and vice versa).

        It might be clear, but it should be noted that for any statement or open sentence <m>P</m> it's true that <m>\sim (\sim P)</m> is logically equivalent to <m>P</m>. So, much like negatives, two negations cancel each other out. Since quantified statements are indeed statements, this holds for them as well.

    <title>Viewing Quantified Statements as a Diagram</title>
    <p>
        It's quite helpful to view these quantified statements as a diagram. Since most students are familiar with the idea of a <term>Venn diagram </term> (which are circles representing groups of objects), this is the tool we will use to help us visualize these statements.
    </p>
    <p>
       We want to be able to represent both universally- and existentially quantified statements. For both types, we first need to draw a box representing the domain of all possible objects under consideration:
    </p>
    <p>
        
        <image source="1.jpg" width="50%">
            <description>First Image</description>

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                For universally quantified statements (e.g., "All A are B" or as a concrete example "All cats are mammals") we want a circle representing all objects that satisfy condition A (all cats in our example).
            </p>
            <p>
                <image source="Section1.4b.svg" width="50%">

                </image>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, we want a circle to represent all objects that satisfy B (in our example, all mammals). Note that since we wish to show all A are B, we want to draw this circle so that all of the A objects are also included in the B circle:
            </p>
            <p>
                <image source="Section1.4c.svg" width="50%">

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
              For existentially quantified statements (e.g., "Some A are B" or as a concrete example "Some cats are grey") we want a circle representing all objects that satisfy condition A (all cats in our example).  
            </p>

                    <description>Fourth Image</description>
                </image>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, we want a circle to represent all objects that satisfy B (in out example, things that are grey). Note that there could be cats that are not grey, and grey things that are not cats, so we need to draw the diagram so that they only partially overlap. We also know that there is definitely at least one A that is B (cat that is grey) since the statement tells us so, therefore we can put a little dot in the intersection to represent that object (the grey cat).
            </p>
            <p>
                <image source="Section1.4e.svg" width="50%">

                </image>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        There is an alternate way of representing a universally quantified statement with overlapping circles. We will hatch out the area where we know is empty (the area that is A but not B, or in our example the area that is cats that are not mammals):
    </p>
    <exercise>
        <p>Using the ideas above, draw a diagram representing the statement "No A are B". </p>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We could represent this in (at least) two ways. One way is as two non-overlapping circles:
            </p>
            <p>
                <image source="Checkpoint1.21a.svg" width="50%">

            </p>
            <p>
                Or as intersecting circles with the intersection hatch out to indicate it is empty.

<subsection xml:id="subsec-EvenOdd">
    <title>Expressing Even and Odd Numbers Algebraically</title>
    <p>
        In the coming sections, we will be using even and odd numbers as examples of quantified and conditional statements. For example, we can say "All pairs of whole numbers <m>a,b</m> that are both odd have a sum <m>a+b</m> that is even and a product <m>a \times b</m> that is odd". 
    </p>
    <p>
        To determine the truth values of these statements, it's not enough to only look at some examples, as we'll see in the upcoming section <xref ref="subsec-Counterexamples"/>. So we will have to learn to express the idea of even and odd numbers it terms of the property that makes them even and odd.
    </p>
    <exercise>
       <p> How would you explain or show to someone that the number 12 is even? How about that 15 is odd? Can you extend these ideas to any even or odd number? </p>
       <solution>
           <p>
               Of course, there are many ways of doing this, but one way is to draw a picture. There is a very good chance that you would do the same thing! Let's start by showing 12 is even:
           </p>
           <p>
            
            <image source="Checkpoint1.22a.svg" width="50%">
                <description>2=2x6</description>
                
            </image>
           </p>
           <p>
               Here we took 12 dots and organized them as 6 rows of 2. Since 12 can be grouped evenly into rows of 2, we know that 12 is even. Hence, we can write <m>12=2 \times 6.</m>
           </p>
           <p>
               In general, the number of rows of 2 isn't particularly important to say that a number is even; it's the fact that we can group the number into *some amount* of rows of 2. Usually we'll express this as <m>k</m> rows of 2. So for a even whole number <m>n</m>, we know <m>n=2k</m> for some whole number <m>k</m>.
           </p>
           <p>
            <figure xml:id="gtgtg">

                </image>
            </figure>
           </p>
           <p>
               To show 15 is odd, you probably drew a picture similar to this:
           </p>
           <p>
            <image source="Checkpoint1.22c.svg" width="50%">
                                <description>15=2x7+1</description>
                            </image>
           </p>
           <p>
               Here we took the 15 dots and organized them into 7 rows of 2, but we had 1 dot remaining where we were unable to complete a full row of two. Hence, we can write <m>15=2 \times 7 + 1.</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Like for even numbers, the number of rows of 2 isn't particularly important to say that a number is odd; it's the fact that we can group the number into as many rows of 2 as possible, we always have 1 left over. Usually we'll express this as <m>k</m> rows of 2 + 1 remaining. So for a odd whole number <m>n</m>, we know <m>n=2k+1</m> for some whole number <m>k</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In picture form:

            </p>
       </solution>
    </exercise>
    <p>
        To summarize: let <m>n</m> be a whole number. 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>

                       Even really just means "divisible by 2".

    <title>What is a Conditional Statement</title>
    
    
    <introduction>
        <p>
            One of the most important type of statements in mathematics is the <term>conditional statements</term> or, more colloqually, <term>if-then statement</term>. These statements are of the form "if P then Q". We call P the <term>condition</term> and Q the <term>conclusion</term> of the conditional statement, or simply the if-part and then-part. We want to know when these statements are true or false, so let's explore this now:
        </p>
    </introduction>

    <exercise>
       <p> Your professor tells you "if you get 100 percent on the next midterm then I will give you ten dollars". In which of the following four situations is the professor lying to you (remember, we say a statement is false if it is indeed a lie): </p>
    
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You get 100 percent, and your professor does give you a dollar
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You get 100 percent, and your professor does not give you a dollar
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You do not get 100 percent, and your professor does give you a dollar
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        You do not get 100 percent, and your professor does not give you a dollar
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    <solution>
        <p>
           The only situation where your professor is lying to you is in situaion 2. Situaion 1 is obviously true, and the statement does not really apply to situations 3 and 4 as the if-part isn't satisfied. We call the statement <term>vacuously true</term> in these two situations.
        </p>
    </solution>
    
    </exercise>

    <p>
        Of course, there is nothing special about the meaning of the if-part and then-part in the previous example. In general we can say that an if-then statement is false when the if-part is true and the then-part is false, and it is true otherwise. Now we can construct a truth table for "it P then Q":
    </p>

    </figure>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-JustifyingConditionalStatements">
    <title>Justifying Conditional Statements</title>
    

<p>
    In math, we're more concerned with if-then statements where both the if-part and then-part are open sentences with variables. For example "if <m>n</m> is an odd integer then <m>n^2</m> is also odd." In these cases, there's an assumed universal quantifier before these: "for all integers <m>n</m> is <m>n</m> is odd then <m>n^2</m> is odd." We don't usually write the quantifier, but it's there in the background. Since it's a universially quantified statement, we want it to be true for all inputs into our variables. 
</p>
    
<p>
   Remembering that an if-then statement is only false when the if-part is true and the then-part is false, an if-then statement like the one above is true exactly when there are no inputs that make the if-part true and the then-part false. 
</p>


<p>
    To prove an if-then statement is true, we need to show that the "dreaded case", where the if-part is true and the then-part is false, never happens. There are three main ways to do this:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Assume the if-part is true, and show that the then part *must* be true. Thus the "dreaded case" is impossible. This is called a <term>direct proof</term>.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Assume the then-part is false, and show that the if-part *must* be false. Thus the "dreaded case" is impossible.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Assume that there is an input that gives the "dreaded case" (where the if-part is true and the thenn-part is false) and show that some sort of contradition arises where mathemathics "breaks".
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    We will mainly focus on direct proofs in this book, though there are a few times where we will see a proof of another type. When we come across those, we will remind everyone of the logic behind those types of proofs.
</p>

<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-Proofs">
    <title>Notes for Additional Understanding</title>
    <p>
        We will mainly focus on direct proofs, though there will be times when we look at the other two types. We will revisit the logic behind those two types when the need arises.
    </p>
</assemblage>



<p>
    Let's look at some examples of direct proofs.
</p>

<exercise>
    <p> Show that the following statements are true using direct proofs:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                if <m>n</m> is an even integer then <m>n^2</m> is even
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are odd integers then <m>a+b</m> is even
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The sum of any six consecutive integers is always odd. (hint: can you reword this as an if-then statement?)
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <solution>
        <p>
            We need to:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        assume that <m>n</m> is even and 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        show that <m>n^2</m> must be even.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            So let's assume that <m>n</m> is even. This means that <m>n=2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. We need to show that <m>n^2</m> is even, thus <m>n^2 = 2( \quad )</m> where the expression in the brackets must be an integer.   
            
            
                Now that we have our set-up, we can prove this result. Consider <m>n^2</m>. By our assumption: <me>
                    n^2=(2k)^2 = (2k)(2k)
                </me>
                               
            
            We know how we need the expression to look algebraically ( as <m>2( \quad )</m>), so we use our creativity to get there:
                <me>
                (2k)(2k) = 2(2k^2)
                </me>
        </p>
            <p> Since <m>2k^2</m> is an integer, we are done. We have shown that we can always express <m>n^2</m> in the form of an even integer, and this is what we wanted to prove. </p>
    </solution>
    <solution>
        <p>
            We need to:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Assume that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are odd and
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Show that <m>a+b</m> must be even.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            So let's write our assumption in terms of the algebraic definition of what it means for a number to be odd. So let <m>a=2r+1</m> and <m>b=2s+1</m> for some integers <m>r,s</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            
                </p>

                    <p>
                        CAUTION!! A very common mistake that students make is to use the same variable for the integers in the two above expressions (e.g. <m>a=2r+1</m> and <m>b=2r+1</m> for some integer <m>r</m>). Note that this would mean that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> would be the same number (depending on the choice of <m>r</m>). We want <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> to be possibly different numbers, so we need two different variables to be able to express this.
                    </p>
                </assemblage>
                    We need to show that <m>a+b=2( \quad )</m> where the bracket is some integer. Now that we have our set-up we can prove the result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider <m>a+b</m>. By our assumption, <me>a+b=(2r+1)+(2s+1)</me>. We know how we need the expression to look, so we can use our creativity to get there: <me>
                        (2r+1) +(2s+1) = 2r+2s+2 = 2(r+s+2)
                    </me>
                    Since the expression in the brackets is the sum of integers, the bracket simplifies to an integer. So we've written <m>a+b</m> in the form we like and we are done.
                </p>
    
    </solution>
    <solution>
        <p>
            As the hint says, it might be easiest to reword this as an if-then statement first. One way to do this is  
            <p>
                If <m>a,b,c,d,e,f</m> are consecutive integers, then <m>a+b+c+d+e+f</m> is odd.
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have a conditional statement we need to:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Assume our integers are consecutive and
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Show their sum is odd
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So let's write our assumption algebraically: Since the variables are just names for our numbers, let's let <m>a</m> be the smallest integer, <m>b</m> be the next smallest, and so on. Since they're all consecutive:
            </p>
            <me>
                b = a+1
            </me>
            <me>
                c=b+1=(a+1)+1=a+2
            </me>
            and similarly
            <me>
                d = a+3
            </me>
            <me>
                e=a+4
            </me>
            and
            <me>
                f=a+5.
            </me>
            <p>
                Now we need to show that we can always write <m>a+b+c+d+e+f = 2( \quad)+1</m> where the bracket is some integer. Let's try to use our creativity to get there:
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider <m>a+b+c+d+e+f</m>. Using our assumption and noting the form we want to get, we can do the following:
                <me>
                    a+b+c+d+e+f=a+(a+1)+(a+2)+(a+3)+(a+4)+(a+5) = 6a+15
                </me>
                We know we want the expression to be of the form <m>a+b+c+d+e+f = 2( \quad)+1</m> so we can "pull out" a 1, and hopefully what is left will have a common factor of 2 so we can factor it out:
                <me>
                    6a+15=(6a+14)+1 = 2(3a+7)+1
                </me>
                
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the expression in brackets is integers multiplied and added together, it is an integer, and thus the sum is odd. We have finished our proof.
            </p>

    <title>Why Proofs Are Important</title>
    <p>
        A good question that you have probably thought about is "why do we even need to prove results like in the previous secion?" and "If I show a few examples is that emough to prove a result?" Let's explore these ideas:
    </p>


<example>
    <p>
        Is the conditional statement "if <m>n</m> is a whole number then <m>n^2+n+11</m> is a prime number" always true? Remember, a prime number is a number divisibile by exactly two numbers, 1 and itself.
    </p>
    <solution>
        <p>
            It is not! However, it may take a while to find a counterexample. If we let <m>n=1,2, \dots, 9</m> we find that <m>n^2+n+11</m> is indeed prime. For example, if <m>n=6</m> then <m>6^2+6+11=53</m> and you can check that 53 is a prime number. However, when <m>n=10</m>, we have that <m>10^2+10+11=121</m> and <m>121=11 \times 11</m> so <m>11</m> is not a prime number. 
        </p>
        
    </solution>
    
   
</example>

<p>
            The moral of the story here is that just doing a bunch of examples isn't enough to guarantee a statement is always true. It's possible that you haven't found a case where the result doesn't hold though a case does indeed exist.
        </p>

<p>
        Additionally, proofs can give you more information about *why* a result is true. If you study the structure of a proof, in many cases it can give you insight into the precise reasons why a result holds. We'll explore this idea in many proofs to come!
    </p>

    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-Counterexamples">
        <title>Counterexamples</title>
        <p>
            When we were learning about conditional statements, we discussed when conditional statements were false. Remember, these are false exactly when the if-part true and the then-part is false. 
            <definition xml:id="def-Counterexample">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                       We call an object that makes the if-part true and the then-part false a <term>counterexample</term> to the conditional statement. 
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
             Whenever we can find a counterexample, we know that the conditional statement is a false one.  
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>The statement "if <m>n</m> and <m>m</m> are odd counting numbers then <m>n \times m</m> is even" is a false conditional statement since it has the counterexample <m>n=3</m> and <m>m=5</m>. Here, the if-part is true (both 3 and 5 are odd numbers) but the then-part is false (<m>3 \times 5 =15</m> is not an even number). Note that this is only one of many (in fact infinitely many counterexamples).</p>
            <p>
                The statement "if <m>x</m> is an integer (positive or negative counting number, or zero)" then <m>x^2-1</m> is non-negative" is a false conditional statement. Here, <m>x=0</m> is a counterexample since <m>x</m> is an integer (if-part true) but <m>0^2-1=-1</m> (then-part false). Note that this is the only counterexample for this conditional statement.
            </p>
        </example>
        <p>
            Even though the first example has infinitely many counterexamples and the second only has one, they are still both considered false in the same way, and that way is "not always true". There is no "degree of falseness".
        </p>

        <assemblage xml:id="assemblage-Counterexamples">
    <title>Notes for Additional Understanding</title>
    <p>
        In the case where a conditional statement is true for some, but not all, elements in the domain of the statement, it's possible to reword the statement to limit the domain so that it is now true. For example, we can change the second example above to "If <m>x</m> is a non-zero integer then <m>x^2-1</m> is non-negative" to make a true conditional statement.

<example>
    <p>A usual rule in most Canadian provinces is "If you are drinking alcohol then you must be at least 19 years old". Which of the following people may be violating this rule?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                A 20 year old
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A person drinking a beer
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A person drinking water
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A 16 year old
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Intuitively, most people know that you would need to check the person drinking beer, and the 16 year old. The person drinking a beer may be under 19, and the 16 year old may be drinking alcohol. Let's analyse this using the idea of a counterexample:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                The 20 year old satisfies the condition "then-part true". Since the only time a conditional statement is false is when the "if-part" is true and the "then-part" false, this can never be a counterexample.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The person drinking a beer satisfies the condition "if-part true". If they also satisfy "then-part false" (so they are under 19 years old) then they would be a counterexample to the rule. You would check this person.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The person drinking water satisfies "if-part false". Just like with 1, there is no possibility thay they can be a counterexample.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The 16 year old satisfies "then part false". If they are also drinking (the "if-part" true) then they are a counterexample. You would check this person.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</example>

<p>
    Even though this was an easy question when you're familliar with the context, many people find reasoning like this *very* challenging to do. Try the next exercise using the same technique as the previous example.
</p>
<exercise>
    <p>
        Each of the following cards have a letter on one side and a number on the other. Here is a rule: “if a card has a D on one side, then it has a 3 on the other”. Your task is to
select all those cards, but only those cards, which you would have to turn over in order to find out whether the rule is true or false. Which cards would you select?  Try your best to explain your reasoning.
    </p>
    <solution>
        <p>
          Just like the previous example, we need to check situations when either:
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <p>
                      The "if-part" is true: if the then-part is false we have a counterexample, and 
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>
                      The "then-part" is false: if the if-part is true we have a counterexample.
                  </p>
              </li>
          </ol>  
        </p>
        <p>
            The cards that satisfy this are the D (the-if part is true) to see if there is a 3 on the other side, and the 9 (the then-part is false) to see if there is not a D on the other side. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Note the A and the 3 can not be counterexamples. There is no way for the if-part to be true and the then-part to be false.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-CondExist">
        <title>The Relationship Between Conditional and Existential Statements</title>
        <p>
            If you think about it, conditional statements with a variable are actually universally quantified statements! There is an implied quantifier hidden in the conditional statement itself. For example, the conditional statement (with the domain of all animals )"if <m>c</m>" is a cat then <m>c</m> is a mammal" is interpreted to mean "for all animals, if <m>c</m>" is a cat then <m>c</m> is a mammal".
        </p>
        <p>
            We can view this as logically equivalent to the statement "all cats are mammals" (again with the domain of all animals), and we can see the link from the Venn diagram of the statement to all true possibilities for the conditional statement:
        </p>
        <p>
            <image source="Section2.5.svg" width="50%">
                <description>All Cats are Mammals</description>
            </image>
        </p>
       <p> Note that the three distinct areas in that diagram represent one of the true possibilities of the conditional statement. The area that does *not* appear is the "dreaded row;" when the if-part is true and the then-part is false. This illustrates that there are no counterexamples for conditional statements that are always true.</p>
       <exercise>
           <p>
               Reword each conditional statement as a universally quantified statement. Then draw a Venn diagram representing each conditional statement as a universally quantified statement, indentify each of the regions, and give an example of an element in each region:
           </p>
           <ol>
               <li>
                   <p>
                       If <m>x</m> is a whole number with a ones-digit of 0 then <m>x</m> is divisible by 5. (domain: all whole numbers)

        <title>Other Forms of Conditional Statements</title>
        <p>
            There are some important related statements to a conditional statement "if P then Q" (for example, if I walk to work then I wear a jacket ). These are the <term>converse</term> where we flip the order of P and Q: if Q then P (if I wear a jacket then I walk to work). The <term>inverse</term> is when we negate both P and Q: if (not P) then (not Q) (if I do not walk to work then I do not wear a jacket). The <term>contrapositive</term> is where we both reverse the order and negate both parts: if (not Q) then (not P): (if I do not wear a jacket then I do not walk to work).
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's formalize these as a definition:
            <definition xml:id="def-ConvInvContra">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let S="if P then Q" be a conditional statement for some P and Q. Then the conditional statement "if Q then P is the <term>converse</term>" of S, the conditional statement "if (not P) then (not Q)" is the <term>inverse</term> of S, and the conditional statement "if (not Q) then (not P)" is the <term>contrapositive</term> of S.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
        </p>
        <p>
            We can show that the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Let's do it using a truth table:
        </p>
        <p>
            <image source="Section 2.6a.svg">
                <shortdescription>Truth Table for "If P then Q"</shortdescription>
            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see that no matter what the truth values for P and Q, the truth value of the original statement "if P then Q" and the contrapositive statement "If (not Q) then (not P)" agree. So, if we want, we can reword a conditional statement to its contrapositive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, note that the contrapositive of the contrapositive is the original statement; the statements get negated again to bring them back to their original truth values, and the if-part and then-part get swapped back as well.

                    Note that the if-part of this statement is a compound, so we have to be careful negating it. If we let A = "have a ones digit of 2" and B = "have a ones digit of 4", we can either say "has a ones digit other than 2 or 4" [not (A or B)] or we can say "does not have a ones digit of 2 and does not have a ones digit of 4" [(not A) and (not B)]. We will use the first, but the second is equally correct.

        <title>Biconditional Sentences</title>
        <p>
            Look at the previous examples in <xref ref="Bicond1"/>. Notice in the first example, the original statement and its converse were true (and, it follows that the inverse and contrapositive are true too!). However, in the second, only the original statement was true. Let's view these as Venn diagrams: 
        </p>

                <shortdescription>If a triangle then a three sided polygon Venn Diagram</shortdescription>

            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the second example, we know there are numbers with ones-digit that aren't 2 or 4 that are still even, so we can think of numbers that do have a ones-digit of 2 or 4 as only a part (later we'll call it a <term>subest</term>) of the even numbers. For example, 10 is a counterexample to "If Q then P" for this example.</p> 
            <p>Looking at the first example, we want both Venn diagrams to be true. The only way for this to be possible is if both circles are actually the same circle! That's because the two ideas of polygons with three sides and triangles are really the same thing. 

                <image source="Section2.7b2.svg">
                    <shortdescription>Biconditional Venn Diagram for Triangles and Three Sided Polygons</shortdescription>
                </image>
                
            These situations are very special, and we can think of one part as just a "rewording" of the idea of the other part. Formally, we call statements where both the original statement and its converse are true <term>biconditional statements</term> and we write it as "P if and only if Q", which means "(if P then Q) *and* (if Q then P)". 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's look a a truth table of the biconditional statement:
        </p>
        <p>
            <image source="Section2.72.svg">
                <shortdescription>Truth Table for Biconditional</shortdescription>
            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here you can see that the biconditional statement is true exacltly when its truth values match. So it can neven be the case that one of P or Q is true and the other false. This idea will inform how we go about proving biconditional statements.

                Which of the following statements can be expressed as true biconditional statements? If so, reword the conditional as a biconditional, and if not, give a counterexample to show why not. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If <m>n</m> is an even whole number then <m>n^2</m> is also an even whole number.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        (Let <m>a,b</m> be integers). If both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive, then <m>a+b</m> is positive.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    This can be a true biconditional statement. We can say: a whole number <m>n</m> is even if and only if <m>n^2</m> is even.
                </p>
            </solution>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    This can not be a true biconditional statement. The converse "if <m>a+b</m> is positive then <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive" has counterexamples. One is when <m>a=3</m> and <m>b=-1</m>.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </exercise>
        <p>
            When we want to prove the biconditional statement "P if and only if Q", we do it in two proofs: first, we prove "if P then Q"; second, we prove "if Q then P". Note that sometimes it's easier to use a logically equivalent form to prove a results (e.g. you can prove the inverse instead of the converse since they are logically equaivalent).
        </p>
        <example>
            Prove " a whole number <m>n</m> is even if and only if <m>n^2</m> is even."
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Let's do "if <m>n</m> is even then <m>n^2</m> is even" first. Then we'll find that it's easier to prove the inverse statement "if <m>n</m> is odd then <m>n^2</m> is odd" than the converse.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Let <m>n</m> be even. Then <m>n=2k</m> for some whole number <m>k</m>. We want to show that <m>n^2 = 2(\text{integer})</m> which would show that it is always even when <m>n</m> is even. Consider <me>
                                n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2).
                            </me>
                         Since <m>2k^2</m> is a whole number, we have written <m>n^2</m> as an even whole number.  
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                          Let <m>n</m> be odd. Then <m>n=2k+1</m> for some whole number <m>k</m>. We want to show that <m>n^2 = 2(\text{integer})+1</m> which would show that it is always odd when <m>n</m> is odd. Consider <me>
                                n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = (2k+1)(2k+1) = 4k^2+4k+1 = 2(2k^2+2k)+1.
                            </me>
                         Since <m>2k^2+2k</m> is a whole number, we have written <m>n^2</m> as an odd whole number.  
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Since we showed that both the original statement and its inverse are true, we have showed the biconditional statement is true.

   <p> We often talk about collections of objects, like whole numbers, or integers, or polygons, or triangles. So far, we've dealt with these just with words but it was pretty repetitive and clumsy. It would be nice (and it is important!) if we had some rules for talking about collections of objects. </p>
   <p>
       In this section, we do introduce our language for collections of objects and their members. We also look at how to combine collections and the relationship between our language for collections and logic.
   </p>
   <p>
   <definition xml:id="def-Set">
       <statement>
           <p>
               A <term>set</term> is a collection of objects, called <term>elements</term>, with some rules attached:
       <ol>
           <li>
               <p>
                 Elements do not occur more than once in a set.  
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <p>
                   The order in which the elements are listed does not matter.
               </p>
           </li>
       </ol>
           </p>
       </statement>
   </definition>
       
   </p>
   <p>
       Often, sets are written with capital letters, like <m>A,B,X,Y</m>, and so on, and elements of these sets are written with lower case letters, like <m>a,b,x,y</m>, and so on. If an object <m>a</m> is an element of a set <m>A</m> we write <m>a \in A</m>. If <m>a</m> is not an element of <m>A</m>, we write <m>a \notin A</m>.
   </p>
   <p>
       There are a few different ways of telling people what elements are in a set. We can:
       <ol>
           <li>
               <p>
                   List the elements; e.g. <m>\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m>
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <p>
                   Describe the elements in words; e.g. <m>\{ \text{all counting numbers from 1 to 5, inclusive} \}</m>
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>
                   Decribe the elements using mathematical notation; e.g. <m>\{ \text{whole numbers} n \ | \ 1 \leq n \leq 5 \}</m>
               </p>
           </li>
       </ol>
       We call the final method <term>set builder notation</term> and read the " <m>|</m> " symbol as the phrase "such that". So, in words, we would read this set builder notation as "whole numbers <m>n</m> such that <m>n</m> is between 1 and 5, inclusive", or some other phrase with an equivalent meaning (for example, greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5).
   </p>

   \<exercise>
       List all of the elements of these sets, which are initially given in a text description or in set builder notation:
       \<ol>
           <li>
               <p>
                   <m>A_1 = \{ \text{all prime numbers less than 11} \}</m>

           <li>
               <p>
                   <m> A_2 = \{ \text{whole numbers} n \ | \ 10 \leq  n(n+1) \leq 25 \} </m>

                   <m>A_3 = \{ \text{NHL teams active in the 2021-2022 season that, as of Jan 1, 2022 have never won a Stanley Cup} \}</m>

           <p>
               <m>A_1 = \{2,3,5,7 \}</m>. Note that 11 is not included as 11 is not less than 11.

       </solution>
       <solution>
           <p>
               It's probably easiest to check this by trial and error. The smallest value of <m>n</m> that satisfies this condition is <m>n=3</m> (as <m>3 \times 4 = 12</m> but <m>2 \times 3 = 6</m>). And the largest value that satisfies this condition is <m>n=4</m> as <m>4 \times 5 =20</m> but <m>5 \times 6 = 30</m>. So <m>A_2 = \{3,4\}</m>.

        </solution> 
       <solution>
           <p>
               You might have to know a bit of hockey to know this, but you can look this up in a table on, say, Wikipedia. Thus <m>A_3 = \{ \text{Panthers, Sabres, Blue Jackets, Jets, Wild, Coyotes, Predators, Canucks, Sharks, Kraken, Golden Knights} \}</m>
           </p>
          
       </solution>
       <solution>
           <p>
               There are *no* prime numbers besides 2 that have an even square, as for any odd number <m>n, n^2</m> is also odd. So <m>A_4 = \{ \}. </m> 
           </p>
       </solution>
   </exercise>
   <p> 
   Remember that sets do not have an order to their elements. It's simply a list of what the set contains. A good analogy for a set is a bag containing the elements in your set:

   </p>
   <p>
      <image source="Section3.1a.svg" >
        <shortdescription>Bag analogy of a set</shortdescription>
      </image>
   </p>
   <p>
        Note that in the previous exercise, we came across the set with no elements. We call this the <term>empty set</term> and write it as <m>\{ \}</m> or with <m>\emptyset.</m>
       
   </p>
   <p>
       It's very useful to be able to talk about sets contained in other sets. We call these subsets. More generally, let A and B be two sets. If all elements of B are also elements of A, then we say B is a subset of A, and we write <m>B \subseteq A.</m> </p>
<example>
   <p> Notice that the definition of a subset contains a quantifier. Use the idea of negation of quantifiers to determine when B is not a subset of A, written <m>B \not \subseteq A</m>. </p>
   <solution>
       <p>
           Remember, to negate a quantifier, we change the quantifier type, and negate the open sentence. So <m>B \not \subseteq A</m> means "There is an element in B that is not in A." In the language of counterexamples, this says that there is a counterexample to the definition of subsets.
       </p>
   </solution>
</example>
<p>
    You can view the idea of a subset using Venn diagrams. In the diagram below, B is a subset of A:
</p>

        <shortdescription>Subset Venn diagram</shortdescription>
    </image>
</p>
<p>
    Let's look at a few examples of subsets to help us understand how the concept works:
</p>

   <example>
      <p> Let's define the following sets: </p>
       <ol>
           <li>
               <p>
                   <m>A = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}</m>
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <p>
                   <m>B = \{2,4,6,8\}</m>
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <p>
                   <m>C = \{1, 2, 4, 6 \}</m>
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <p>
                   <m>D = \emptyset</m>
               </p>
           </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
           Let's check if <m>B \subseteq A</m>. If we find one element that is in B but not in A, then <m>B \not \subseteq A.</m>. Note that <m>8 \in B</m> but <m>8 \not \in A</m>. We've found a counterexample to the definition of a subset, thus <m>B \not \subseteq A.</m>
               
        </p>
        <p>
            Is <m>C \subseteq A</m>? We can see that all of the element of C, that is 1,2,4, and 6, are also elements of A. Thus <m>C \subseteq A.</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Is <m>D \subseteq A</m>? Yes! This is "vacuously true" as there is no counterexample to the definition of subset. Alternatively you can view it the following way: The statement <m>D  \not \subseteq A</m> is not true, as there is no element of D that is not an element of A. So if <m>D \not \subseteq A</m> is false, it must be that its negation <m>D \subseteq A</m> is true.
        </p>
        <p>
            Is <m>A \subseteq A</m>? Of course! Every element of A is also an element of A (obviously!). 
        </p>
   </example>
   <p>
       Another concept that is important to us is the number of elements in a set A, which we call the <term>cardinality</term> of A. We write this <m>|A|</m>.
   </p>
   <example>
       Let's let A,B,C, and D be the sets above. Also let <m>E = \{ \text{all even ounting numbers} \}.</m>. Then <m>|A| = 7,  \ |B| = 4, \ |C|= 4, \ |D| = 0, \ |E| = \infty</m>.
   </example>

   <assemblage xml:id="assemblage-Sets">
    <title>Notes for Additional Understanding</title>
    <p>
        There's no limit to the types of objects sets can contain, and can even contain other sets. There is a lot more to be said about sets (there is an entire branch of mathematics dedicated to studying them), but it's beyond the scope of this book.
    </p>
</assemblage>

   <p>
       Another important concept is when two sets have the same elements. We say that sets A and B are <term>equal</term>, and write <m>A=B</m> if A and B have exactly the same elements. Alternatively, we can say that <m>A=B</m> when <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq A</m>.
   </p>

   <example>
      <p>  Let <m>S_1 = \{ 2,3,5,7\}</m> and <m>S_2 = \{\text{prime numbers less than 10}\}</m>. Since all prime numbers less than 10 are 2,3,5 and 7, we have that <m>S_1 = S_2</m>. </p>
   </example>

   <p>
       There are a few sets of numbers that we talk about quite a lot (you've probably noticed that so far). Since they are so commonly used, mathematicians have some notation for these, and we'll use this throughout the rest of the textbook to save time and space.
   </p>
   <ul>
       <li>
           <p>
               We let <m>\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,4, \ldots \}</m> and call it the set of <term>natural numbers</term>, or <term>counting numbers</term>.
           </p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <p>
              We let <m>\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0,1,2,3,4, \ldots \}</m> and call it the set of <term>natural numbers with zero</term>, or <term>whole numbers</term>. 
           </p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <p>
               We let <m>\mathbb{Z} = \{ \ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \} </m> and call it the set of <term>integers</term>. Note that some other textbooks might use the symbol <m>\mathbb{I}</m> instead, but <m>\mathbb{Z}</m> is most common.
           </p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <p>
               We let <m>\mathbb{Q} = \{ \dfrac{a}{b} \ | \ a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } b \neq 0 \text{ and the usual rules for equivalent fractions hold} \}</m> and call it the set of <term>rational numbers</term>. Note that this is saying that the set contains all fractions with integer numerators and denominators, but we cannot have a denominator of 0.
           </p>
       </li>
       <li>
           <p>
               We let <m>\mathbb{R} = \{ \text{all numbers on the number line} \}</m> be the set of <term>real numbers</term>. This set includes numbers like <m>\pi, \sqrt{2},</m> and all others.
           </p>
       </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
       From the following diagram you can see that these sets are listed in a "subset ordering", that is <m>\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{N}_0 \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}</m>.

   <exercise>
      <p>Let A,B,C be sets that aren't the empty set (so <m>A,B,C \neq \emptyset</m>). Show that if <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq C</m> then <m>A \subseteq C</m>. </p>
      <solution>
          <p>
              Note the this is an if-then statement. So we need to show that it's never the case that the if-part is true and the then-part is false. But, in the definition of subsets we have additional if-then statements as well, so we have to be careful with these "nested" conditional statements.
          </p>
          <p>
              Let's assume the if-part is true: that <m>A \subseteq B</m> and <m>B \subseteq C</m>. So this means that if <m>x \in A</m> then <m>x \in B</m> (since A is a subset of B) and if <m>x \in B</m> then <m>x \in C</m> (since B is a subset of C).
          </p>
          <p>
              We need to show that the then-part is true; that A is a subset of C, so if <m>x \in A</m> then <m>x \in C</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
              So now, using the if-part assumption, let's show that the then-part is true. Let <m>x \in A</m>. By our assumption that <m>A \subseteq B</m> we know <m>x \in B</m>. Now, by the second part of our assumption, that <m>B \subseteq C</m> we know that <m>x \in C</m>.
          </p>
          <p>Since we started with an element of A and showed that it must be an element of C, we have shown the then-part; that <m>A \subseteq C</m>, and this means we've proved that the if-then statement is always true.</p>
          <p>
              Note that you can see this visually using the following Venn diagram:

       Looking at the Venn diagram for subsets, you may have realized that it's the same as the diagram for conditional statements, which is very related to the universal quantifiers. In fact, they are very related concepts, and we can view the same Venn diagram with these three lenses.
   </p>
   <p>
       For example, we can phrase the same idea in three ways:
       <ol>
           <li>
               <p>
                   All cats are mammals
               </p>
               <p>
                   If something is a cat, then it is a mammal.
               </p>
               <p>
                   Cats are a subset of mammals.
               </p>
           </li>
       </ol>
   </p>
   <p>
       Let's label the same Venn diagram using the three viewpoints:

           An important thing we wish to do is to be able to talk about set operations. These are very related to logical operations from the previous section.
       </p>
       <p>
           Sometimes we like to keep track of when objects (like numbers) satisfy all conditions, and other times we like when they satisfy at least one. And another thing we like to talk about is when objects satisfy one condition, but not another. Let's introduce some notation for this:

       <example>
           <p>
               PUT EXAMPLE HERE THAT SHOWS WHY THESE ARE IMPORTANT

           Finally, we like to talk about *all* objects that do not satisfy a rule. However, we have to be careful that we limit the objects just to those that we're interested in talking about.

                       Since elements in an intersection need to satisfy *both* being a memebr of A and B, we have that <m>A \cap B = \{ \text{ obtuse triangles} \}</m>.

                   </p>
                   <p> A possible example of an element in this set is a triangle with one angle of 100 degrees:

                       An possible example of an element not in this set is a square:

However, triangles are polygons of at most 5 sides (they have three), we have that <m>A \subseteq C</m> and thus we can express <m>A \cup C = \{ \text{ all polygons of at most 5 sides.} \}</m> and note <m>A \cup C = C</m>.

                       and a non-example would be a hexagon since it has more than 5 sides:

                   <p>
                       Since elements in complement are all elements not in the original set, we have that <m>\sim B = \{ \text{ all polygons with no obtuse angles } \}</m>. In a future Geometry chapter we will show that this set will only contain certain triangles and quadrilaterals (polygons with 4 sides).

                   </p>
                   <p>
                       An example of an element in the set is a square, since it has all angles of measure exactly 90 degrees (and not larger):

                        <shortdescription>Picture of a square</shortdescription>

                        A non-example is a triangle with one angle with measure 100 degrees:
                        <image source="Checkpoint3.15a.svg">

                   <p>
                       Note that the examples and non-examples from the previous part work for this set as well.

               <solution>
                   
                   <p>
                       Elements in the set difference need to satisfy being a memebr of A but not A. However there are, of course, *no* elements that are both a member and not a memeber of a set. Thus, we have that <m>A - A =\emptyset</m>.

                       Note that since the set is empty, no polygon is an example of an element in the set, and every polygon is a non-example.
