        <title>Intro To Equality</title>
        <p>
        In our mathematical career we have used the equals symbol "=" countless times. In this section, we talk about what it actually means and its implications. We'll focus on equality of numbers, but know that equality is a concept that is used in many different concepts in mathematics;m for example, two sets can be equal, or two polygons can be equal.

    <definition xml:id="def-Equality">
        <statement>
            <p>
                We say that two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are <term>equal</term>, and write <m>a=b</m>, if and only if they are the same quantity. Note that they may be expressed in different ways. 
            </p>
                    </statement>
    </definition>
     <example>
        <p>
        Here are a few examples stating what we mean. 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>2+3=1+4</m>. This means that these two expressions are the same number (in this case <m>5</m>) written in different ways.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Another important and common example is equality of fractions. We will explore this more later in the book, but we know that <m>/frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If we write <m>x=7</m>, this means that whenever we see the quantity <m>x</m> again in our problem, we can say that it is the same as the number <m>7</m>. Thus we can "substitute" <m>7</m> for <m>x</m> whenever we like.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        A good idea is to think of equality as a balance. If both sides are equal, then the balance will be balanced; neither side will be heavier than the other.
    </p>

        </image>
    </p>
    <p>
        If one side of the equation, then we have an <term>inequality</term> since the two sides do not equal each other. If the left hand side (LHS) is the heavier side then we say that the LHS <term>is greater than</term> the right hand side (RHS). If the RHS is larger, than we say that the LHS <term>is less than</term> the RHS. Note that the symbol to denote either greater than <m>&gt;</m> and less than <m>&lt;</m> has the more open side toward the larger quantity, somewhat matching up with the idea of the balance.

        There are a few properties of equality that are important and intuitive, but for completeness we write them down here:

            Note that the three properties above are used to define another, more general, concept in mathematics called an <term>equivalence relation</term>. Informally, this is a type of relation, but it calls objects equaivalent if they behave the same way in only ways that you are interested in working with. For more information, see any discrete mathematics textbook.

        <p>
            The most important property of equality when doing mathematics is that you can always <term>substitute</term> one expression for another equal to it. In fact, this is how many algebraic equations are solved, and arithmetic expressions simplified. We regularly do this whenever we simplify an arithmetic expression, but many of us do not realize we are doing a substitution when we do it! For example, if we are calculating the expression <m>4 \times 7 - 3</m>, we know that <m>4 \times 7 = 28</m>. Since these two quantities equal each other, we can substitute <m>28</m> any time we see the expression <m>4 \times 7</m>. Doing this, we get <m>28-3</m>, and we know that <m>28-3=25.</m> So, putting it all together we have that <m>4 \times 7 -3 = 25</m>. We can view this idea using the balance model descibed above: 
        </p>
        <p>
            <image source="WholeNumbers/BalanceModelSub1.svg">
                <shortdescription>Balance model of 4*7-3=25</shortdescription>
            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            We use this idea when solving equations as well. Suppose we know that <m>x=9</m> and we're asked to calculate <m>3x-16</m>. Since <m>x</m> and <m>9</m> are indeed equal we can substitude a <m>9</m> where ever we see the variable <m>x</m>. Doing so we obtain <m>3(9)-16</m>. Similarly to above we can simplify this to <m>27-16=11</m>. And thus <m>3x-16=11</m> when <m>x=9</m>. Again, we can use a balance model to show this process:
        </p>
         <p>
            <image source="WholeNumbers/BalanceModelSub2.svg">
                <shortdescription>Balance model of 3x-16=11 when x=9</shortdescription>
            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another important property to equality is that two expressions remain equal when we do the same arithmetic operations to them. For example, if we know <m>a=b</m> we can subtract 5 from both of these and the resulting expressions equal: <m>a-5=b-5</m>. </p> 
            <p> <image source="WholeNumbers/BalanceModelSub3.svg">
                <shortdescription>Balance model of a-5=b-5 when a=b</shortdescription>
            </image> </p>
            <p> Or for another example, we could divide both sides by 2, and then <m>a \div 2 = b \div 2</m>. </p> 
            <p><image source="WholeNumbers/BalanceModelSub4.svg">
                <shortdescription>Balance model of a/2=b/2 when a=b</shortdescription>
            </image></p> 
            <p> This is an incredibly powerful idea that allows us to solve equations for a unknown quantities.
        </p>

            Let's define these more precisely so we can refer to them later.

        </definition>
        <p>
            The next example will talk about how the above properties of equality allow us to solve equations using two methods. 
        </p>

      <example>
          <p>
              Suppose we know that Angela is thirty years younger than her father. Also, that in ten years, Angela will be half the age of her father at that time. Let's determine Angela's current age, and her father's current age.          </p>

              <p>
                  First, we ask "what quantities are we interested in, but are unknown?". In this example, we are interested in Angela's current age and her father's current age. To help us write these algebraically, let's give these quantities variable names (and we need to be specific about what these variables stand for, so that readers, and ourselves, do not get confused.)
              </p>
              <p>
                  Let <m>A := </m> Angela's current age (in years), and let <m>F := </m> Angela's father's current age (in years).
              </p>
              <p>
                  Since Angela is thirty year's younger than her father, we need to think about how to translate this to an algebraic statement. We can think of trying to reword this sentence to have the concept of equality in it. For example, we could say "Angela's age plus thirty years is the same age as her father" or "If you subtract thirty years from her father's age, it will be Angela's age" or something else. Using the first rewording, we can make the algebraic equation
              </p>
              <me>
                  A+30 = F.
              </me>
              <p>
                  For the second sentence, we need to be careful; remember that this holds in ten years time. So Angela's age in ten years is <m>A+10</m> and her father's is <m>F+10</m>. Now we know that in ten years, Angela will be half the age of her father, which means if you double her age then, it will be equal to her father's age. So we can write
              </p>
              <me>
                  2 \times (A+10) = F+10.
              </me>

              <p>
                  Now, in our problem both equations are things that are true, so we can use both at the same time. Here we can use substitution to replace the <m>F</m> in the second equation with <m>A+30</m> since these quantities equal in the first equation. This way, we will end up with an equation with only one unknown/variable, which we can solve using the properties of arithmetic of equal expressions.
              </p>
              <me>
                  2 \times (A+10) = (A+30)
              </me>
              <p>
                  Expanding the bracket on the left hand side:
              </p>
              <me>
                  2A+20 = A+30
              </me>
              <p>
                  Subtracting <m>A</m> and <m>20</m> from both sides (this will have our variable only on one side and our constants only on the other)
              </p>
              <me>
                  A = 10
              </me>
              <p>
                  So we know that Angela's current age is <m>10</m> years old. We can then use the first equation to find her father's current age using substitution again:
              </p>
              <me>
                  (10) + 30 = F
              </me>
              <me>
                  40 = F
              </me>
              <p>
                  and thus Angela's father's current age is <m>40</m> years old.
              </p>

    <title>Problem Solving</title>
<introduction>
     <p>
        In order to solve problems, it helps to be comfortable solving algebraic equations. In this section we will first talk about solving algebraic equations of a certain type (called linear equations), solving multiple linear equations at the same time, and then talking about some problem solving strategies that you can use to try and get a handle on a problem where the answer and/or approach isn't immediately obvious. 
    </p>
<p>
    First, let's give somewhat careful definitions of the objects we care about in equations, and the types of equations we wish to solve. For this section, all coefficients of variables will be integers (that is, positive or negative whole numbers) but some of the solutions to our equations may be rational numbers. In general, these techniques will work with any real numbers in most situations.
</p>

<definition xml:id="def-TermsEtc">
    <statement>
        <p>
            An <term>expression</term> is a combination of mathematical symbols without a relational symbol (e.g. <m>=, \leq</m>) symbol relating it to another combination of mathematical symbols. A <term>term</term> is an expression that does not include a addition or subtraction operation (outside of necessary brackets). </p><p> A <term>coefficient</term> of a term that includes a variable is the number that variable is multiplied by. </p><p> Terms only containing numbers are called <term>constants.</term> </p><p> </p><p> An <term>equation</term> is two equal expressions with an equal sign between them. </p><p> To <term>solve</term> an equation for a variable <m>x</m> means to perform arithemtic operations on both sides of the equation (while maintaining equality) so that the equation is now in the form <m>x = \ldots</m>. Note that if there is only one variable, specifying the variable is usually omitted.
        </p>

    </statement>
    <example>
        <p>
            Consider the equation <m>3x+4= 5-6x</m> which is made of two expressions, <m>3x+4</m> and <m>5-6x</m> . In the term <m>3x</m> on the left hand side (or LHS) of the coefficient is <m>3</m>, and in the term <m>-6x</m> on the right hand side (or RHS) of the equation the coefficient is <m>-6</m> (here, we are viewing <m>5-6x</m> as <m>5+(-6)x</m>. We will be more precise about this later in the book.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes we can have unknown coefficients even in terms with variables, but we specify that these are indeed coefficients. For example, we could have the expression <m>ax+by</m> where we are thinking of <m>x,y</m> as our variables and <m>a,b \in \mathbb{N}</m> as our coefficients.

<definition xml:id="def-LinearEquation">
    <statement>
        <p>
            An equation over one (or more) variables is called a <term>linear equation</term> exactly when every term of the equation has at most one variable in it, and that variable has an exponent of <m>1</m>.
        </p>
        
    </statement>

    <example>
            <p>
                <m>3x+4 = 6x-7</m> is a linear equation since each term has (at most) one copy of <m>x</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, <m>3x+4y=7</m> is another linear equation since both <m>3x</m> and <m>4y</m> have exactly one copy of <m>x,y</m> in them, and <m>7</m> has no <m>x</m>'s or <m>y</m>'s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now a non-example: <m>3xy-4x^2=6</m> is *not* a linear equation. Here there are two problems (onte that just one is enough to disqualify it from being a linear equation): the first term has two variables in it, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Also the second term has two copies of <m>x</m> multiplied together, since by the definition of exponents <m>x^2 = x \times x.</m>

          Before we get into the idea of translating a "real world" problem into the language of mathematics, we'll go over some very important skills to solve many of these problems, which is solving linear equations (or systems of equations). Let's start with the simplest of cases: solving one equation with one variable.  
       </p>

       <p>
           Let <m>x</m> be the symbol for our variable, and let <m>a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}</m> be our coefficients. After collecting like terms, any linear equation can be written in the form <m>ax+b=cx+d</m>. As long as <m>a \neq c</m> we can follow these following steps (called an algorithm) to solve for our variable <m>x</m>.
       </p>
       <ol>
           <li>
               <p>
                   Subtract <m>cx</m> and <m>b</m> from both sides of the equation. This gives us 
                   <me>
                       ax+b -cx-b = cx+d -cx - b
                   </me>
                   <me>
                        \rightarrow ax-cx  = d-b 
                   </me>
                   <me>
                       \rightarrow (a-c)x=d-b
                   </me>
                   
                   
                   
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <p>
                   Divide everything on both sides by the coefficient <m>a-c</m>. This gives us
               </p>
               <me>
                   \dfrac{(a-c)x}{(a-c)} = \dfrac{(d-b)}{(a-c)}.
               </me>
               <p>
                   Cancelling out the <m>a-c</m> we have
               </p>
               <me>
                   x = \dfrac{(d-b)}{(a-c)}.
               </me>
               
               
           </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
           We could just memorize the formula above, but there are so many different situations that arise in mathematics that it isn't feasable to remember everything. However, if you have a strong knowledge of the ideas behind equality and arithmetic of equations, you can recreate this when the need arises. 
       </p>
       <example>
           <p>
               Let's solve <m>x+5=8</m>. The easiest way to view this is asking "what number can I add to 5 to get 8". We can formally solve for <m>x</m> here by subtracting 5 from both sides:
               <me>
                   x+5-5=8-5
               </me>
               <me>
                   \rightarrow x = 3.
               </me>
               We can solve this using the general algorithm above by viewing the equation as <m>x+5=0x+8</m>. Then <m>x = \dfrac{8-5}{1-0} = 3.</m>
               
               
           </p>
           <p>
               We can solve <m>7(a-4)=4-(4-3a)</m> by first expanding out the brackets and then combining like terms so that the equation is in the standard form given in the algorithm:
               <me>
                   \rightarrow 7a-28 = 4-4+3a
               </me>
               <me>
                   \rightarrow 7a -28 = 3a.
               </me>
               Noting that we can view the RHS of the equation as <m>3a+0</m>, we can now use our algorithm above, giving us <m>a = \dfrac{0-(-28)}{7-3} = \dfrac{28}{4} = 7.</m>
               
               
           </p>
           <p>
               We can check our answers by substituting our solution for the variable and making sure that equality holds. For the second equation we have <me>7(7-4) \mathop{=}\limits^? 4-(4-3(7))</me>
               <me>
                   \rightarrow 7(3) \mathop{=}\limits^? 4-(4-21)
               </me>
               <me>
                   \rightarrow 21 \mathop{=}\limits^? 4-(-17)
               </me>
               <me>
                   \rightarrow 21 = 21.
               </me>
               Since we do indeed have equality our solution is correct.

        <title>Intro to Systems Of Equations</title>
        <p>
            In many scenarios, we are given two (or more) relationships between two (or more) unknown quantities and we need to use these to find the unknown quantities that satisfy these relationships. 
        </p>
        <example>
        <p>
            A typical problem might look like this:
        </p>
            <p>
                On Monday, you spend <m>\$ 9</m> to buy two medium coffees and one pizza burger. On Tuesday, you spend <m>\$ 15.50</m> to buy three medium coffees and two pizza burgers. How much is one medium coffee, and how much is one pizza burger?
            </p>
        <p>
            Let's define <m>C:=</m> the price of a medium coffee (dollars) and <m>P:=</m> the price of a pizza burger (dollars). We can translate the two sentences above to the equations
        </p>
        <me>
            2C + P = 9
        </me>
        <me>
            3C + 2P = 15.5.
        </me>
        <p>
            Here, we can check that if a medium coffee is $2.50 and a pizza burger is $4, that is <m>C=2.5</m> and <m>P=4</m>, both equations are satisfied, and thus both of the sentences above are true:
         </p>
         <me>2(2.5)+4 = 9</me>
         <me>
             3(2.5)+2(4) = 15.5
         </me>
        
         
        
            
        </example>
            <p>
                In this section, we will learn some methods of solving problems like finding these quantities in the example above. Note that we will limit our study to situations with <m>2</m> linear equations and <m>2</m> variables (which we call "2 by 2 systems of equations") but these methods can be expanded to solve larger systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, let's define a system of equations. Note that unless otherwise stated, all equations are linear equations.
            </p>
            <definition xml:id="def-SystemOfEquations">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        A <term>system of equations</term> is a set of equations where equality holds in each of these simultaneously; that is, all equations are true at the same time.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <example>
                    <p>
                        The two equations in the previous example are a system of equations. We know that two coffees and two pizza burgers coming to $9 is true, and we also know that similarly for the other equation. So both equations are true simultaneously.
                    </p>
                </example>

    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-Substitution">
        <title>Substitution</title>
        <p>
            We can use the ideas of equality to help us solve systems of equations. Remember from REFERENCE, when two expressions equal, we can substitute one for the other whenever it is convenient. The idea is that since we know how to solve one equation with one variable, so we want to convert a 2 by 2 system of equations into one equation with one variable via <term>substitution.</term> Let's look at the example in the previous section:
        </p>
        <p>
            REFERENCE
        </p>
        <p>
            We have the system
        </p>
        <me>
            2C + P = 9
        </me>
        <me>
            3C + 2P = 15.5.
        </me>
        <p>
            Notice that both equations have the variables <m>C</m> and <m>P</m> in them. If we could "substitute out" one of the variables in terms of the other by first solving one of the equations for one of the variables, then we would be in a familiar situation with one equation and one variable. This will be our goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            There isn't a "correct" choice of variable to solve for (any will indeed do!) we notice it seems easiest to solve for <m>P</m> in the fist equation, as it has a coefficient of <m>1</m>, so we do not have to divide at the end to solve for <m>P</m>. Solving for <m>P</m> in the first equation we have
        </p>
        <me>
            P = 9-2C.
        </me>
        <p>
            Now any time we see a <m>P</m> in an equation we can replace, or "substitute"  it with <m>9-2C</m>. Let's do this substitution in the second equation:
        </p>
        <me>
            3C+2(9-2C) = 15.5.
        </me>
        <p>
            Here we have one equation with the one variable <m>C</m>, so we can use the steps to solve this from the previous section:
        </p>
        <me>
            3C+18-4C = 15.5
        </me>
        <me>
            -C+18 = 15.5
        </me>
        <me>
            -C=-2.5
        </me>
        <me>
            C = 2.5.
        </me>
        <exercise>
            <p>
                Describe the steps in each line of the previous part of this example.
            </p>
        </exercise>
        <p>
            Now that we know <m>C = 2.5</m> we can substitute this in to either equation to solve for our other unknown, <m>P.</m> We will substitute this into the first equation:
        </p>
        <me>
            2(2.5)+P = 9
        </me>
        <me>
            5 +P=9
        </me>
        <me>
            P = 4.
        </me>
        <exercise>
            <p>
                Describe the steps in each line of the previous part of this example.
            </p>
        </exercise>
        <p>
            Now that we have values for all of our variables, we have solved this system of equations. We can check our work by substituting both values into the other equation to make sure equality does indeed hold (as we want both equations to be true simultaneously.)
        </p>
        <me>
            3(2.5) + 2(4) \mathop{=}\limits^?  15.5
        </me>
        <me>
            7.5+ 8 \mathop{=}\limits^?  15.5
        </me>
        <me>
            15.5=15.5.
        </me>
        <p>
            Since we do indeed achieve equality in both equations, we have our solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's write these steps as an algorithm:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Choose one of the variables in one of the equations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Solve the equation for this variable.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Substitute this into the second equation for the solved variable. You now have one equation with at most one variable. If you have no variables left, you either have infinitely many solutions or no solutions (we will be able to tell which later in the chapter).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If it still exists, solve this equation for the variable. You should have some number. If there are no variables left, go to REFERENCE.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Substitute this number into either equation and solve for the remaining variable.

                    Check your work by substituting the solved values for both variables into the other equation from the previous part. If you do indeed have equality, your solution is a soloution for the system of equations.

            <title>Elimination</title>
            <p>
                There is another method for solving systems of equations that involves cleverly adding or subtracting multiples of one equation from another. We will explore why this method works, but first we will see the method in action:
            </p>
            <example>
                <p>
                    Let's look at the same example as in the previous sections; that is, the system of equations
                </p>
                 <me>
            2C + P = 9
        </me>
        <me>
            3C + 2P = 15.5.
        </me>
        <p>
            Let's subtract two times the first equation from the second equation (we'll write this as II - 2I, where I is the first equation and II is the second) by performing the operations on either side of the equals sign separately; when we do that, we will "eliminate" the variable <m>P</m> from the second equation, and then we'll be left with one equation with one variable:
        </p>

        <me>
            [II - 2I] \rightarrow [3C+2P - 2(2C+P) = 15.5-2(9)]
        </me>
        <me>
            \rightarrow 3C+2P - 4C - 2P = 15.5-18
        </me>
        <me>
           \rightarrow -C = -2.5
        </me>
        <me>
            \rightarrow C = 2.5.
        </me>

        <p>
            Now that we know <m>C=2.5</m> we can substitute that in to either equation and solve for <m>P</m>, similarly to the previous example. Thus we have <m>P = 4</m>.
        </p>
        
        
        
            </example>

            <p>
                As you can see, both methods give the same answer (which is a good thing, of course!). But why does this method work? We will give an example in the case of subtraction, but any operation will work. Note that in practice, addition and subtraction are the most useful in these scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine we had a system of two equations. We will call the left hand sides of the first and second equation <m>L_1</m> and <m>L_2</m>, repsctively. Similarly, we will call the right hand sides <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m>. (Note that in our previous example <m>L_1 = 2C+P</m> and <m>R_1 = 9</m>). We can view the system in general as
            </p>
            <me>
                L_1 = R_1
            </me>
            and
            <me>
                L_2 = R_2.
            </me>
            <p>
                By the property of arithmetic equality, we can subtract <m>L_2</m> from both sides of Equation I. Thus:
                <me>
                    L_1-L2 = R_1-L_2
                </me>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Now since <m>L_2 = R_2</m> we can use the property of substitution to substitute <m>R_2</m> for <m>L_2</m> in the right hand side:
                <me>
                    L_1 - L_2 = R_1 - R_2
                </me>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, we have subtracted Equation II from Equation I and showed thar the idea of elimination makes sense.
            </p>
            <exercise>
                <p>
                    Use the above explanation as a guide to justify that if <m>L_1 = R_1</m> and <m>L_2 = R_2</m> then <m>L_1 + L_2 = R_1 + R_2</m>.
                </p>
            </exercise>
            <p>
                A few notes:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The method of elimination is more useful when you have larger systems of equations with more equations and/or more variables. In the <m>2 \times 2</m> case, substitution is generally easy enough to do. However, it is good practice to be able to us the elimination method, as it is extremely more efficient and useful than substitution in these larger systems.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You can eliminate any variable using any equation in your system that you want. It's usually a good idea to choose a variable with small/easy-to-work-with coefficients, but if you choose another variable, you will still get the correct result.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Once you choose a variable to eliminate, a common and useful technique is to multiply each equation by the cofficent of the variable in the other equation, and then add or subtract to eliminate that vaariable.
                        </p>

  <title>Whole Numbers</title>

  <p>
    Place value is a very important concept that allows us to write down very large (and very small) numbers in a small amount of space. If we didn't have the concept of place value, we would simply use the number of "ticks" we wanted to write down to represent that number. For example, if we wanted to write down "twenty" we would do something like the following:
  </p>
  <p>
     <image source="WholeNumbers/20Ticks.svg">
        <shortdescription>20 tick marks</shortdescription>
     </image> 
  </p>
  <p>
     And if we want to represent the number "one hundred and twelve" we would write:
     
  </p>
  <p>
      <image source="WholeNumbers/112Ticks.svg">
        <shortdescription>112 tick marks</shortdescription>
      </image>
  </p>
  <p>
      You can see how difficult it would be to write down and understand large numbers, or to easily do operations with them, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  </p>
  <p>
      The idea of place value is incredibly powerful. It allows us to represent quantities with something more compact and useful than "a bunch of ticks". For example, the number ten is (usually) represented by 10, which is really a 1 followed by a 0. In this chapter, we'll talk about the concept of place value, what we need in order to be able to express any number using the idea of place value (called a numeration system), and how we can use the ideas of place value to easily add, subtract, multiply, and divide whole numbers. 
  </p>

<section xml:id="sec-NumberSystems">
    <title>Number Systems</title>
    <subsection>
    <title>Introduction to Number Systems</title>
    
    
    <p>
        Consider the following objects:
    </p>
    <p>
        <image source="WholeNumbers/5Ticks.svg">
            <shortdescription>5 tick marks</shortdescription>
        </image>
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to work with the idea of quantities, we want some symbol to represent this number of quantities, and other numbers of quantities too. In the Western world (and much of the rest of the world too) we've chosen the symbol "5" to represent these quantities. Note that it doesn't mean these particular five things, but simply the idea of having that many of anything.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-Numeral">
        <statement>
            <p>
                A <term>numeral</term> is a representation of a quantity of some type.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
        Note the difference between a numeral and a number: a number is the actual amount, whereas a numeral is some symbol that represents this amount.
    </p>
    <p>
        Numerals, however important as they are to being able to work with and understand quantities, isn't enough. Just imagine if we had a completely unique symbol for every whole number there is, and there are infinitely many so this is impossible anyway. So, we use the idea of place to represent any number we like using a finite (and usually small) amount of symbols. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Think about why we write the number "eleven" with the numerals 11. What does this actually mean? We have two 1's, but they're playing different roles solely due to their location in the numeral. The leftmost 1 means "one ten" and the rightmost 1 means "one one". So, really, we read that number as "one ten and one one," whose number happens to have the name "eleven".
    </p>
    <p>
       For a number system using place value to indicate a number, we need to have a few necessary things:
       <ol>
           <li>
               <p> 
                   A symbol for indicating zero and a symbol for indicating one
               </p>
           </li>
           <li>
               <p>
                   A set  <m>D</m> of unique numeral symbols, <term>digits</term> for representing consecutive numbers (beginning with zero and one) without the concept of place value.
               </p>
           </li>
           
       </ol> 

    </p>
<p>
    Note that <m>|D|</m> is called the <term>base</term> of our number system. For example, our base ten number system has the digits <m>\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}</m> and any number larger than nine we can represent using the place of digits.
</p>
<p>
    Note that in base <m>b</m>, <m>|D| = b</m> and <m>D = \{0,1,2, \ldots, b-1, b\}.</m> So, for example, in base <m>7</m> the digit set is <m>D=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>. Note that these are all the possible remainders when dividing whole numbers by 7.
</p>
<p>
    How does place value work? Let's see what happens as we count up from one to twelve:
</p>
<p>
    <image source="WholeNumbers/Section 4.1 - 2.svg">
        <shortdescription>Counting from 1 to 12 using counting blocks</shortdescription>
    </image>
</p>
<p>
    The idea is that once we reach nine ticks, we "run out" of digits to express any larger numbers with their own symbol. So, we group ten of these together to make one "ten" and we express this as a digit to the left of the ones place.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, let's count from ninety-seven to one hundred-three:
</p>
<p>
    <image source="WholeNumbers/Section 4.1 - 3.svg">
        <shortdescription>Counting from 97 to 103 using counting blocks</shortdescription>
    </image>
</p>
<p>
    You can see once we add an additional tick (or one) to ninety-nine, we then have ten ones. So we regroup those ones to one ten. Now this gives us ten tens, and since we have ten of those, we need to regroup them into a new place, called the hundreds place.
</p>
<p>
    We'll look at models of multiplication and exponents in a later place in the book, but we will rely on our intuition about multiplication and our knowledge of exponents to help us talk about place value. We know that in our base ten number system, we group ten of one place to make one of the next place. We start with the ones place, which we can express as <m>10^0</m>, as any non-zero number to the power of <m>0</m> is <m>1</m> (we will see why later.) So we know that we can express the tens place as 10 ones<m>=10 \times 1 = 10^1</m> (remembering that an exponent of 1 is the same as having no exponent). We can also think of a "long" as being a one-dimensional object; that dimension being length.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly we group 10 tens to make one hundred: <m>10 \times 10=10^2=100</m>. Similarly to a "long" we can view the hundred "square" as a two dimensional object, with length and width. Hopefully you are noticing the relationship to the exponent of the place.
</p>
<p>
    We group 10 hundreds to make one thousand: <m>10 \times 100=10^1 \times 10^2 = 10^{1+2} = 10^3 = 1000</m>. Similarly to a "long" and "square" we can view the thousand "cube" as a three dimensional object, with length, width, and depth. 
</p>
<p>
    As we can really only think in three dimensions well (some mathematicians can visualize some higher dimensions, but not too many!), we can't think of a ten-thousand as a four-dimensional object. However, we can "reunitize" and think of the thousand as a new type of unit. Then, one ten-thousand <m>10 \times 1000=10 \times 10^3 = 10^4</m> can be visualized as a "long" made up of ten-thousands, a hundred-thousand <m>10^5</m> can be viewed as a square made up of ten ten-thousands. We "reunitize" again when we hit one million, and reunitize after every three places. This may be why we decided to express places in "name", "ten-name", and "hundred-name".
</p>
<p>
    This idea of expressing a number in its places will be very helpful later on. For example we can write
    
</p>
<me>
    57642 = 5\times 10^4 + 7 \times 10^3 + 6 \times 10^2 + 4 \times 10^1 + 2 \times 10^0.
</me>
<p>
    We call this the <term>expanded place form</term> of a number. Note that we write <m>10</m> as <m>10^1</m> and <m>1</m> as <m>10^0</m> to highlight the pattern of decreasing exponents as you move from left to right.
</p>




<p>
    A good question is "is there anything special about regrouping in units of ten ?" or in the language of number systems "why do we use base ten?" The answer to this is no! We can indeed have a base of any counting number we like (say in base <m>b</m>) and then regoup once we have <m>b</m> of any place. 
</p>
<p>
    Let's try writing "thirteen" in a few different bases so that you get a feel for what is happening:
</p>
<p>
    <image source="WholeNumbers/Section 4.1 - 4.svg">
        <shortdescription>Counting blocks of thirteen in different bases</shortdescription>
    </image>
</p>
<p>
    We can write these as the following numerals (note that the base is written as a subscript so that you know what base each number is in. We'll keep this practice up when needed.)
    <me>
        13_{ten} \ 15_{eight} \ 23_{five} \ 11_{twelve} \ 1101_{two}
    </me>
    
</p>

<p>
    We'll explore different bases as this chapter progresses. To have a solid understanding of place value, you should be able to understand numbers written in any base, and be able to work with other bases when doing arithmetic.
</p>
<p>
    Note that in our examples, we group ones into "long" pieces, then we group "longs" into squares, then we group squares into cubes In base ten the longs are tens, the squares are hundreds, and the cubes are thousands. Note that the cube just looks like a "big" one, and thus is why we repeat tens, hundreds, thousands, when we do place value (REWORD THIS!)
</p>
<p>
    The idea of expanded place form extends to any base too. For example, we can write <m>1537_{eight}</m> in its expanded place form: <m>1 \times 10^{3}_{eight}+5 \times 10^2_{eight}+3 \times 10^1_{eight}+ 7 \times 10^0_{eight}</m>. Remember we are thinking in base eight, so <m>10^{3}_{eight}</m> is the number <m>8 \times 8 \times 8 = 512</m> in base ten, <m>10^2_{eight}</m> is the number <m>64</m> in base ten, and so on. To avoid any confusion, we'll only use the words "tens", "hundreds", etc to refer to base ten, and block names like "longs", "squares", etc to refer to places in any base.
</p>

<p>
    As our number system is base ten, we almost have too much "muscle memory" to be able to think about how place value works, and how our algorithms for doing arithmetic work. So we'll frequently change to other bases for this chapter.

    <title>Converting From Base Ten</title>
    

<p>
    Let's think about how to change from one base to another. 
</p>
    
<example>
    
<p> Let's start in base ten. Suppose we wanted to write the base ten number 25 in base four. We can start by thinking to breaking up all of the base ten groupings into single ones:
    </p>
<p>
    <image source="WholeNumbers/Example 4.2 - 1.svg">
        <shortdescription>Expressing 2 tens and 5 ones as 25 ones in base ten blocks</shortdescription>
    </image>
</p>
<p>
    Then, we can make as many groups of four ones (longs) as possible (we'll regroup those later):
</p>
<p>
    There! We've made six longs, and we have 1 one left over. Now we have more than four longs so let's regroup four of them into one sixteen (square):
</p>
<p>
    <image source="WholeNumbers/Example 4.2 - 2.svg">
        <shortdescription>Regrouping 25 ones into 6 longs and 1 one in base four</shortdescription>
    </image>
</p>
<p>
    Now, we have 1 square, 2 longs, and 1 one. So we can write this number as <m>121_{four}</m>.

</example> 
<p>
    Let's do one more example: </p>

    <example>
        <p>Let's write the number 77 in base five. First, we make as many groups of five as we can:</p>

                <shortdescription>Regrouping 77 ones into longs in base five</shortdescription>
            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            We have divided the 77 ones into 15 groups of five (longs) with 2 remaining. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we group our 15 longss into groups of five, giving us groups of twenty-five, or squares:

            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we have 3 squares, and 2 ones. Can we write this as <m>32_{five}</m>? No! Be careful here. We are missing a place; we have no fives, so we need to indicate that with the digit 0: so we should write <m>302_{five}</m>. Note that <m>32_{five}</m> is 3 fives and 2 ones, which is 17. This is why that 0 digit is important!
        </p>
        
    </example>
    <p>
        Let's analyze the examples above to come up with a procedure to convert any base ten number into a different base.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Divide our base into the number of ones. The remainder is our ones digit.
            </p>
            
            
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                
                Take the quotient of the step above and divide our base into that. The remainder is the next digit to the left.
            
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Repeat the previous step until we have a quotient of 0. Then you have your number in the desired base.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

        Let's view the previous example in terms of division:

      <title>Converting To Base Ten</title>
      <p>
          How can we convert in the other direction? If we have a number in, for example, base six, how can we determine which number it is base ten? Let's look at an example:
      </p>
      <example>
          <p>
              Let's look at <m>2514_{six}</m>. What does this mean? Reading from right to left, we have 4 ones, 1 long, 5 squares, and 2 cubes. Longs are 6 ones, squares are <m>6 \times 6= 6^2 = 36</m> ones, and cubes are <m>6 \times 6 \times 6 = =6^3 = 216</m> ones. We can now add all of the ones and group in our usual base ten:
              <me>
                  2 \times 6^3 + 5 \times 6^2 + 1 \times 6 + 4 \times 1 = 622

      <p>
          Let's do one more example:

      </p>
      <example>
          <p>Let's look at <m>10010101_{two}</m>. Here we have 1 one, 0 longs of size <m>2^1</m>, 1 square of size <m>2^2</m>, and similarly 0 <m>2^3</m>, 1 <m>2^4</m>, 0 <m>2^5</m>, 0 <m>2^6</m>, and 1 <m>2^7</m>. So we have:
          <me>1 \times 2^7 + 0 \times 2^6 + 0 \times 2^5 + 1 \times 2^4 + 0 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 1</me>
          <me>
              = 128 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 0+ 4 + 0 + 1 = 149

          Just like before, let's determine a method for converting from any base to base ten:

                  <p>
                      1. Multiply the digits in the place value spot by the value of the place.

                  <p>
                      Sum these together in usual base ten arithmetic.

          <title>Base Twelve</title>
          <p>
              So far, we've only dealt with bases of ten or less. But there's nothing stopping us from dealing with bases larger than ten. The only thing is that we, so far, only have digits for numbers from 0 to 9. If we're not allowed to regroup until we have twelve things (ones, longs, etc) we need new digits to represent the numbers "ten" and "eleven". There aren't any really standard choices for these digits, but let's choose "A" to mean "ten" and "B" to mean "eleven".
          </p>
          <p>
             To get a feel for base twelve, let's count in base twelve, starting at one, and going to fifteen.

          </p>
          <p>
              It might take a while to wrap your head around not regrouping when you have ten things, but in base twelve we do not.
          </p>
          
          <example>
              <p>
                  Let's convert a base ten number to base twelve to get a feel for it. Let's start with 155 and use our algorithm above.
                  <me>
                      155 = 12 \times 12 + 11
                      </me>
                      <me>
                      12 = 1 \times 12 + 0
                      </me>
                      <me>
                      1 = 0 \times 12 + 1
                  </me>
                  So 155 in base twelve is <m>10B_{twelve}</m>. Note that since we have eleven ones remaining, we write that in base twelve as <m>B</m>.

    <title>Arithmetic Operations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section, we will talk about the four main operations of arithmetic of whole numbers; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The idea is that we will start with the idea of addition, and "build" the others from that. Indeed, mathematicians like to start with as little as possible, and making as many results and ideas out of this starting place as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we talk about these operations, we can then talk about some nice properties that (some of) these operations have, which allows us to rearrange and regroup numbers so we can easily perform operations. Then, we'll talk about common (and uncommon!) rules, called algorithms, that we use to do arithmetic. We'll learn the steps in the algorithms, and why these algorithms work!
        </p>
        <p>
            A reminder; we use the notation <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m> to mean the set of whole numbers <m>\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}</m>.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-Addition">
        <title>Addition</title>
        <p>
            Addition is an operation that we usually have an intuitive grasp of. There are two common ways of viewing addtion (called addition models); the "set model," where we combine two sets (with no elements in common; that is, and empty intersection) into one set, and the "number line model", where we start at one number on the umber line, and add additional spaces according to the number we're adding to the first one. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the set model:
            <image source="WholeNumbers/7+4Set.svg">
                <shortdescription>Set Model for 7+4</shortdescription>
            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the number line model:
            <image source="WholeNumbers/7+4Line.svg">
                <shortdescription>Number Line Model for 7+4</shortdescription>
            </image>
        </p>
        <p>
            As addition is quite intuitive, we'll take the ability to add numbers as a given (in math we call this an <term>axiom</term>). 
                
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-Addition">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>a,b \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. We say <m>c \in \mathbb{N}_0</m> is the <term>sum</term> of the <term>addends</term> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and we write <m>a+b=c</m>.  
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Be careful when adding numbers representing objects or units; if you have different objects or units you cannot simply add the two numbers. 
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                Of course 3 apples + 4 apples = 7 apples, but if we are adding different objects we cannot add the numbers representing them; if we have 3 apples and 4 oranges, we cannot say we have 7 since we're treating apples and oranges as different objects. 
           </p>
           <p>
            However, if we wanted to add up the amount of pieces of fruit we had without making a distinction between apples and oranges, we would have 7 pieces of fruit. In short, in real world applications, your choice of units matters.

            <title>Notes for Additional Understanding</title>
            <p>
               Though we're taking addition to be our "axiom" that we are using to define all other operations, mathematicians usually build up the ideas of whole numbers and addition from sets themselves. This approach, while more fundamental, is a bit beyond the scope of what teachers need to understand.

        <p>
            Before we talk about subtraction, let's talk about how to compare numbers; that is, how to tell if one number is larger than another. We want to "build" all ideas from addition, so let's see if we can come up with a way of describing this using only addition and whole numbers.

                    The key to this is realizing I can add a (non-zero) counting number to 7 to get 11. In our case it is 4. So we can say that <m>7 &gt; 4</m> since we found the number 4 such that <m>11=7+4</m>.

                    We can apply the exact same logic to this problem; the only thing different are the numbers! So we can say <m>15 &gt; 3</m> since there is a number (12) where <m>15 = 3 + 12</m>. </p>

                <p>
                    If <m>a &gt; b</m> then there is a <m>c \ in \mathbb{N}</m> such that <m>a=b+c</m>.

                Now that we have the idea of comparing numbers, we can develop a definiton of subtraction of whole numbers. Before looking at the definition, see if you can take the "greater than or equal to" definition and modify it to a definition for subtraction.
            </p>
            <definition xml:id="def-subtraction">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>a,b \in \mathbb{N}_0</m> where <m>a \geq b</m>. Then we define the subtraction <m>a-b</m> to be the unique <m>c \in \mathbb{N}_0</m> such that <m>a=b+c</m>.  
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
            <p>
                Note that this <m>c</m> is the same number <m>c</m> in the definition for "greater than or equal to". And we wanted the set to include zero since we want to be able to subtract 0, or have an answer of 0. We will get into subtraction with negative answers when we talk about integers in a later section.
            </p>
            <example>
                <p>
                    Let's let <m>a=7</m> and <m>b=2</m>. Since <m>7 &gt; 2</m> we can talk about <m>7-2</m> using our defintion. We know <m>7-2=5</m> since <m>5</m> is the unique number such that <m>7=2+5</m>. So in the definiton above, we have that <m>c=5</m> We can view this subtraction via the following diagram.

        <introduction>
             <p>
            There are many ways to think about multiplication, but one of the most common is to think of it as repeated addition. That way, we can define multiplication in a way that uses a concept that we have already talked about, namely addition. 
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-Multiplication">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>a,b \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. We define <m>a \times b</m> to be <m>a</m> copies of <m>b</m> added together. In the case where either <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m> we define <m>a \times b</m> to be <m>0</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <p>
                We can view this repeated addition. Consider the example <m>4 \times 3</m> in the following diagram.
            </p> 
            <p>

        </definition>

        <p>
            Another way of viewing the multiplication <m>a \times b</m> is as an area or array. Really, this idea is very similar to the number line model, except each group of <m>b</m> is directily to the right of the first group. Later, we will see that this model is an excellent one for thinking about multiplication of fractions and decimals too. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, let's model <m>4 \times 3</m>:

                MOVE SECTION TO AFTER PROPERTIES OF ARITHMETIC Just like how multiplication is a nice way of writing repeated addition, it's very useful to be able to have the idea of repeated multiplication. To write  <m>a \times a \times a \times  \ldots \times a</m>, where <m>a</m> is multiplied by itself <m>b</m> times, we write <m>a^b</m>, where we call <m>a</m> the <term>base</term> and <m>b</m> the <term>exponent.</term>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <p>
                    We can write <m>4 \times 4 \times 4</m> as <m>4^3</m> since <m>4</m> is multiplied by itself <m>3</m> times.
                </p>
                
            </example>
            <p>
                It's clear that for any whole number <m>a</m> we have <m>0^a=0</m>. Also, for any whole number <m>a</m> we say <m>a^1 = a</m> and if <m>a \neq 0</m> we say <m>a^0=1</m>. Note that we leave <m>0^0</m> undefined; as this causes a lot of trouble if we try and give this meaning. We will see why later. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's try and come up with some rules for multiplying exponents. What if we wanted to multiply <m>3^2 \times 3^4? </m>. We could write
                <me>
                    \quad 3^2 \times 3^4
                    = (3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3).
                    = (3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3)
                    = 3^6

       <p> Now that we have the idea of multiplication as repeated addition, we can view its inverse operation, division, as repeated subtraction.</p>

       <p>
           First, an example to see what we mean:
       </p>
       <example>
           <p>
               Let's say we wanted to do the division problem <m>21 \div 5.</m> We can view this as counting the number of times we can subtract 5 from 21 until we're unable to anymore (without going in to negative numbers). We know
               <me>
                   21-5=16
                   16-5=11
                   11-5=6
                   6-5=1
               </me>
               and since 1 is less than 5 we cannot subtract 5 from 1 using our definition of subtraction. We were able to subtract 5 four times from 21, so we say that <m>21 \div 5 = 4 \ R \ 1</m> since there is 1 remaning at the end of this repeated subtraction. Let's look at this in general:

       </example>

       <definition xml:id="def-Division">
           <statement>
               <p>
                   Let <m>a,b, q, r\in \mathbb{N}_0</m> with <m>b \neq 0</m>. Then we say that <m>a \div b = q \ R \ r</m> if and only if there are unique numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>  where <m>a = q \times b+r</m> and <m>0 \leq r \leq (b-1)</m>.

       </definition>
       <p>
           We call <m>a</m> the <term>dividend</term>, <m>b</m> the <term>divisor</term>, <m>q</m> the <term>quotient</term>, and <m>r</m> the remainder. As <m>b \neq 0</m> is part of this defintion, we say the expression <m>a \div 0</m> is <term>undefined</term>; that is, the concept of division isn't defined when <m>b = 0</m>.</p> 
           <p>Note just like us defining subtraction in terms of something we already knew, we defined divison in terms of multiplication and addition. So we're on solid footing here; if we ever forget what division means, we just look up this definition which is in terms of multiplication and addition, which, if we forget, we can look up the definition of those too. This seems like it's overkill for such simple concepts (and it is in a way) but this is how mathematicians think about concepts so it's good practice to do this for easy and intuitive ideas like arithmetic. 
       </p>
       <p>
           We can also view the division <m>a \div b</m> as the number of groups of size <m>b</m> you can make out of <m>a</m> objects. This is called the <term>measurement model of division.</term> Let's look at <m>43 \div 4</m>.
       </p>
       <p>
           INSERT PIC OF DIVISION BY GROUPING
       </p>
       <p>
           The division <m>a \div b</m> can be viewed in another way as well; we can ask if we wish to partition <m>a</m> objects into <m>b</m> groups, how many objects are in each group? This is called the <term>partitive model of division</term> (the word "partitive" being related to the idea of a partition). Again, we look at <m>43 \div 4</m> using this model
       </p>
<p>
           INSERT PIC OF DIVISION INTO GROUPS

               It's intuitive that every division problem <m>a \div b</m> has one answer, that is one quotient <m>q</m> and remainder <m>r</m> that make the equation <m>a=qb+r</m> true.

        There are some important properties of arithmetic operations that are worth pointing out and discussing. We use them regularly, and we will rely on them especially in the coming section on algorithms for arithmetic. Let's use the symbol <m>\square </m> to mean any one of our arithmetic operations. Note that we can think of all of our operations *combining* two numbers to make another number.

                Since addition of two whole numbers gives us another whole number, we have that the set <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m> is closed under <m>+</m>. Similarly, <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m> is closed under <m>\times</m> as well. However, <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m> is *not* closed under subtraction, since (as a counterexample to the if-then statement in the definition of closure) <m>2-4 = (-2)</m>. We know that <m>2,4 \in \mathbb{N}_0</m> (so the if part of the definition is true) but <m>(-2) \notin \mathbb{N}_0</m> (so the then part of the definition is false).

        <example>
            <p>
                In <m>\mathbb{N}</m>, addition and multiplication are associative. For example, <m>(4 \times 3) \times 2 = 4 \times (3 \times 2)</m> and <m>(3 + 7)=4 = 3+ (7 +4)</m>. We can view these pictorally:

            <p>
                Now in <m>\mathbb{N},</m> subtraction is *not* associative. As a counterexample, we have <m>(6-4)-1 = 2-1 =1</m> but <m>6-(4-1) = 6-3 = 3</m>.

                <p>
                   Using associativity and distributivity can help us do arithmetic more quickly and easily. For example, if we were to add <m>7+5+11+4+8+3,</m> we can look for pairs (or triples, etc) of numbers that sum to a multiple of ten. Using associativity and commutativity we can rearrange the above to 
                   <me>
                       7+5+11+4+8+3 = (7+3) + (11+5+4) + 8 = 10 +20 +8 = 38
                   </me>
                   
               </p>
               <p>
                   Similarly for multiplication, we can look for number that multiply together to give a power of ten. This will make our multiplication much easier. For example, if we were to multiply <m>4 \times 7 \times 5 \times 15</m> we could use associativity and commutativity to rearrange to above to

                <me>
                   <m>4 \times 7 \times 5 \times 15 = (4 \times 5) \times 7 \times 15</m> 
                </me>
                <me>
                    = 20 \times 7 \times 15 = (20 \times 15) \times 7
                </me>
                <me>
                    =300 \times 7 = 2100.

                       The easiest way to view why distributivity holds is via a picture using the array model of multiplication. Consider a chocolate bar with <m>6</m> horizontal blocks and <m>8</m> vertical blocks. In total, the chocolate bar has <m>6 \times 8 = 48</m> blocks: 
                    </p>

                       Now, let's "break" this chocolate bar between the 3rd and 4th vertical block thus giving us 3 blocks in the first section and 5 in the second (of course, we still have the same amount of chocolate). So we can view this now as <m>6 \times (3+5)=48</m>. But we could calculate the number of blocks separately in each of the two sections, and then add them together. Obviously we would still have the same amount of chocolate. So there are <m>6 \times 3+ 6 \times 5 = 18 + 30 = 48</m> blocks of chocolate.

                        This idea represents the idea behind distributivity. Note that distrivutivity is *very* important when we start discussing methods for multiplying in a later section.

                Note that we can extend the idea in the previous example to any number of "cuts" in our chocolate bar. We could show this more formally, but the following examples should give an idea of how this works

            <example>
                <p>
                    Let's look at <m>8 \times 9</m>. We can break <m>8</m> into <m>6+2</m>, and <m>9</m> into <m>5+4</m>. Thus we can view <m>8 \times 9</m> as <m>(6+2) \times (5+4)</m>. Viewed as a chocolate bar as in the previous example:

                <p>
                    We can now multiply the constituent parts and the add them together to obtain the final answer. Note that we multiply each number in the first bracket by each number in the second. So <me>8 \times 9 = (6+2) \times (5+4)</me> <me> = 6 \times 5 + 6 \times 4 + 2 \times 5 + 2 \times 4</me> <me> = 30 + 24 + 10 + 8 = 72 </me>.

                There is nothing special about the numbers in the previous example. In fact, we can do this for any numbers. In fact, if <m>a,b,c,d </m> are numbers then <m>(a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad +bc +bd</m>.

            <title>Related Subtraction and Division Problems</title>
           <p>
               Using the definitions of subtraction and division (in terms of addition and multiplication, respectively) and the property of commutativity, if we know the answer to one subtraction or division problem (with a remainder of <m>0</m>), we know the answer to another related subtraction or division problem. 
           </p> 

           <p>
               Let's explore this with a few examples first (which is always a good idea), and then we can think about what is happening in general.
           </p>
           <example>
               <p>
                   Consider the subtraction problem <m>11-4=7</m>. Intuitively, we are taking away <m>4</m> from <m>11</m> to leave <m>7</m>. However, there is no real difference between the ideas of "taking away" and "leaving". We're simply separating <m>11</m> into two groups; one of size <m>4</m> and one of size <m>7</m>.
               </p>
               <p>
                   INSERT PIC HERE
               </p>
               <p>
                  So <m>4</m> and <m>7</m> are playing similar roles here. We can see this in the definition of addition: we know <me>11-4 = 7</me> since <m>7</m> is the number such that <m>11 = 4+7</m>. However, we can use the idea of commutativity to swap the <m>4</m> and <m>7</m>: <me> 11=7+4</me> and thus <m>4</m> can be viewed as the number, when added to <m>7</m>, to have a sum of <m>11</m>. This is the definition of the subtraction problem <me>
                      11-7=4.
                  </me> So we have two related subtraction problems, <m>11-4=7</m> and <m>11-7=4</m>.
                   
                   
               </p>

            
           </example>

           <example>
               <p>
                   Now consider the division problem <m>15 \div 5 = 3</m>. This means that <m>3</m> is the number such that <me>15 = 3 \times 5</me> (note there is no remainder here so we don't have to worry about that part of division). Like the previous example, we can use commutativity to swap the <m>3</m> and <m>5</m>: <me>
                       15 = 5 \times 3.
                   </me>
                   Thus we can view <m>5</m> as the number, when multiplied by <m>3</m>, to give you a product of <m>15</m> and thus <me>
                       15 \div 3 = 5.
                   </me>
                   
               </p>

                <p>
                    INSERT PIC OF DIVIDING 15 DOTS BY 5, AND BY 3 (vertical and horizontal groupings should do)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thus we have two related division problems: <m>15 \div 5 = 3</m> and <m>15 \iv 3 = 5</m>.
                </p>
               
           </example>

           <p>
               If we look (somewhat) carefully at the last two examples, we notice that there is nothing special about any of the numbers in the examples; the important part in the first example is splitting the top number of the subtraction into two parts, and in the second example it's grouping our dividend horizontally and vertically (in the area model of division). We can generalize this idea to any numbers being subtracted or divided (in the case of division, with remainder of 0) using the exact logic of above. Let's write these out as theorems below. It's a good idea to try and prove these ourselves before looking at the proof given.
           </p>



           <theorem xml:id="thm-RelatedSubtraction">
               <statement>

                       Let <m>a,b,c \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. If<m>a-b=c</m> then <m>a-c=b</m>.
                   </p>
               </statement>
               <proof>
                   <p>
                       Let's assume the if-part of the conditional statement is true. Assume that <m>a-b=c</m>. Using the definition of subtraction, this means that <m>a=b+c</m>.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       We wish to show that <m>a-c=b</m>. Let's keep that in our mind so that we know where we are working to.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       Since we know that <m>a=b+c</m>, using commutativity of addition we have that <m>a=c+b</m>. By the definition of subtraction, this means that <m>a-c=b</m>. Thus we have shown what we wanted to show.
                   </p>
               </proof>
           </theorem>

            <p>
                The proof for division is very similar to the subtraction proof. If you have looked at the proof for subtraction, see if you can modify it to be a proof for the division result.

                       Let's assume the if-part of the conditional statement is true. Assume that <m>a \div b=c</m>. Using the definition of division, this means that <m>a=b \times c</m>.

                   <p>
                       Since we know that <m>a=b \times c</m>, using commutativity of multiplication we have that <m>a=c \times b</m>. By the definition of subtraction, this means that <m>a \div c=b</m>. Thus we have shown what we wanted to show.

        <title>Multiplication By Zero</title>
        
    
    <p>
        Does it have to be the case that multiplication by zero always gives and answer of zero, or is that something we just decided because it works (more specifically, do we need to make an axoim covering multiplication by zero)? In fact, it's somthing that *must* follow from previous properties we've discussed. An important result that can be proved from axioms or previous results is called a <term>theorem</term>. Let's write this as a theorem, and then prove it. We have to be careful here, since we may be tempted to simplify <m>a \times 0 = 0</m>, but we need to put ourselves in the mindset of the first person ever to think about this; we have no idea what it could equal, so we need to solve for it using some properties that we know.
    </p>
    <example>
        
        <theorem xml:id="thm-atimeszero">
            <statement>
                <p>

                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
            Let <m>a</m> be a number and let's consider <m>a \times 0</m>, which is our unknown expression; this is what we need to solve for. Remember, we *cannot* simplify this. The key to this is trying to come up with a way of finding something equal to <m>a \times 0</m> and then using some algebra to solve for our unknown expression. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One way of doing this is remembering the multiplicitave identity and additive indentity properties. Let's be very precise here, and make sure we label all of the properties we are using. By the multiplicative identity property we know <me> a \times 1 = a</me> and by the additive identity property we know <me> 1+0 = 1 </me>. Using substitution of equal expressions we can write <me>a \times (1+0) = 1 </me>. Now using distributivity we can say that <me> a \times 1 + a\times 0 = a</me>. Again, by multiplicitive identity we can simplify this to <me>a + a\times 0 = a </me>. Finally ,by arithmetic of equal expressions we can subtract <m>a</m> from both sides to have <m>a \times 0 = 0</m>.           
        </p>
       
        
            </proof>
        </theorem>

         <p>
            Keep in mind what this is saying; if we want 1 to be the multiplicitave identity, 0 to be the additive identity, and the properties of equality and distributivity to hold, it *must* be the case that <m>a \times 0 = 0</m>. So this is a consequence of these properties; if we want to live in a mathematical world where these properties hold, then multiplying by zero *must* give you an answer of zero.

      Integers are a fundamental concept in mathematics, extending the idea of whole numbers to include negative numbers. An integer can be understood as a solution to the equation <m>x + a = 0</m> for natural numbers <m>a</m>. This means that for any natural number <m>a</m>, there exists an integer <m>x</m> such that when <m>a</m> is added to <m>x</m>, the result is zero. This concept introduces the idea of negative numbers, allowing us to perform arithmetic operations in a more comprehensive number system.

        Integer addition involves combining positive and negative numbers in various ways. Understanding how to add integers requires us to consider different cases, including adding two positive numbers, two negative numbers, and a positive and a negative number. Visualizing integer addition can be helpful, especially using number lines or counters to represent the values being combined.

          Visualizing integer addition can make it easier to understand how different numbers interact. One common method is using a number line, where positive and negative numbers are represented as positions relative to zero. For example, adding a positive number involves moving to the right, while adding a negative number involves moving to the left. Another method is using counters, where positive numbers are represented by one color (e.g., red) and negative numbers by another color (e.g., blue). Combining these counters can help visualize the result of the addition.

          <p>
            1. **Adding Two Positive Integers**: The sum is always positive. For example, <m>3 + 5 = 8</m>.

          </p>
          <p>
            3. **Adding a Positive Integer and a Negative Integer**: The sign of the sum depends on which absolute value is larger. For example, <m>3 + (-5) = -2</m> and <m>-3 + 5 = 2</m>. In both cases, we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.

        <p>
          Integer addition possesses several important properties that make it a consistent and reliable operation. These properties include commutativity, associativity, closure, inverses, and the additive identity.
        </p>
  
        <subsubsection xml:id="commutativity">
          <title>Commutativity</title>
          <p>
            The commutative property states that the order of addition does not affect the sum. In other words, <m>a + b = b + a</m> for any integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. This property is useful because it allows flexibility in the order of operations, simplifying calculations and making mental arithmetic easier.
          </p>

          <title>Associativity</title>
          <p>
            The associative property states that the way in which numbers are grouped in addition does not affect the sum. In mathematical terms, <m>(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</m> for any integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>. This property ensures that when adding multiple integers, the grouping of the numbers can be adjusted to simplify computation.

        <subsubsection xml:id="closure">
          <title>Closure</title>
          <p>
            The closure property states that the sum of any two integers is always an integer. This means that the set of integers is "closed" under addition, and adding any two integers will never result in a number that is not an integer. This property is fundamental to the integrity of the number system, ensuring that operations within the set remain consistent.

This property is important because it introduces the concept of negation, allowing for the representation of negative numbers and the balancing of equations.

      <title>Properties of Integer Multiplication</title>
      <p>
        Integer multiplication has several important properties, including commutativity, associativity, distributivity, closure, and the existence of a multiplicative identity.
      </p>
  
      <subsubsection xml:id="commutativity-multiplication">
        <title>Commutativity</title>
        <p>
          The commutative property states that the order of multiplication does not affect the product. In other words, <m>a \times b = b \times a</m> for any integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. This property allows flexibility in the order of operations, simplifying calculations and making multiplication consistent regardless of order.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>
  
      <subsubsection xml:id="associativity-multiplication">
        <title>Associativity</title>
        <p>
          The associative property states that the way in which numbers are grouped in multiplication does not affect the product. Mathematically, <m>(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)</m> for any integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>. This property ensures that when multiplying multiple integers, the grouping of the numbers can be adjusted to simplify computation.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>
  
      <subsubsection xml:id="distributivity-multiplication">
        <title>Distributivity</title>
        <p>
          The distributive property states that multiplication distributes over addition. For any integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, the following holds true: <m>a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)</m>. This property is essential for simplifying expressions and solving equations that involve both addition and multiplication.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>
  
      <subsubsection xml:id="closure-multiplication">
        <title>Closure</title>
        <p>
          The closure property states that the product of any two integers is always an integer. This means that the set of integers is "closed" under multiplication, ensuring that operations within the set remain consistent and the result is always an integer.
        </p>
      </subsubsection>
  
      <subsubsection xml:id="multiplicative-identity">
        <title>Multiplicative Identity</title>
        <p>
          The multiplicative identity property states that there exists an integer, 1, which, when multiplied by any integer <m>a</m>, results in <m>a</m>. In other words, <m>a \times 1 = a</m>. This property highlights the unique role of one in the number system, serving as the identity element for multiplication.

      <title>Integer Division</title>
      <p>
        Integer division involves dividing one integer by another, resulting in a quotient and sometimes a remainder. Unlike multiplication, division does not always produce an integer, and understanding how to handle these cases is crucial. This section will cover visualizing integer division and the rules for dividing integers.
      </p>
  
      <subsubsection xml:id="visualizing-integer-division">
        <title>Visualizing Integer Division</title>
        <p>
          Visualizing integer division can help clarify the process of dividing positive and negative numbers. One common method is using a number line, where division by a positive number involves dividing the number line into equal parts. Division by a negative number can be interpreted as moving in the opposite direction. Another method is using counters or tiles, where dividing the total number of counters into groups can represent the division process.

      <subsubsection xml:id="how-to-divide-integers">
        <title>How to Divide Integers</title>
        <p>
          Dividing integers involves several scenarios:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. **Dividing Two Positive Integers**: The quotient is positive. For example, <m>10 \div 2 = 5</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. **Dividing Two Negative Integers**: The quotient is positive. For example, <m>-10 \div (-2) = 5</m>. This is because dividing two negative values results in a positive value.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. **Dividing a Positive Integer by a Negative Integer**: The quotient is negative. For example, <m>10 \div (-2) = -5</m>. This is because a positive value divided by a negative value results in a negative value.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. **Dividing a Negative Integer by a Positive Integer**: The quotient is negative. For example, <m>-10 \div 2 = -5</m>. This follows the same rule as above.
        </p>
  
        <example xml:id="integer-division-example-1">
          <title>Example: Integer Division</title>
          <p>
            Calculate <m>-20 \div 4</m>.
          </p>
          <solution>
            <p>
              We have a negative number divided by a positive number, which results in a negative quotient.
            </p>
            <me>
            -20 \div 4 = -5
            </me>
            <p>
              Therefore, the quotient is <m>-5</m>.
            </p>

        </example>
  
        <example xml:id="integer-division-example-2">
          <title>Example: Integer Division Word Problem</title>
          <p>
            A company made a loss of $60,000 over 12 months. What was the average monthly loss?
          </p>
          <solution>
            <p>
              To find the average monthly loss, we need to divide the total loss by the number of months.
            </p>
            <me>
            -60000 \div 12 = -5000
            </me>
            <p>
              Therefore, the average monthly loss was $5000. This example shows how integer division can be used to calculate averages and distribute values evenly across different periods.
