  <title>Operations on Sets</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Just like we can do arithmetic with numbers—adding, subtracting, multiplying—we can do operations with sets. But instead of computing values, we're working with collections of elements. These operations help us compare, combine, and understand how sets relate to one another.

    <title>Union and Intersection</title>

    <p>
      Imagine you and your friend are each picking your favorite animals. Your list includes {cat, dog, turtle}, and your friend chooses {parrot, cat, rabbit}.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want a list that includes <em>any</em> animal either of you likes, you would take the <term>union</term> of your lists. If you're only interested in animals you <em>both</em> like, that would be the <term>intersection</term>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-UnionIntersection">
      <statement>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets.
      </statement>
      <ulist>
        <item>The <term>union</term> <m>A \cup B</m> is the set of elements that are in <m>A</m>, in <m>B</m>, or in both.</item>
        <item>The <term>intersection</term> <m>A \cap B</m> is the set of elements that are in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.</item>
      </ulist>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <p>
        Let <m>A = \{1,2,3\}</m> and <m>B = \{2,3,4,5\}</m>. Then:
      </p>
      <ulist>
        <item><m>A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,5\}</m></item>
        <item><m>A \cap B = \{2,3\}</m></item>
      </ulist>
    </example>

    <exercise xml:id="ex-UnionIntersectionVisual">
      <title>Visualize Union and Intersection</title>
      <p>
        Draw two overlapping circles labeled <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Fill in the values of <m>A \cup B</m> and <m>A \cap B</m> from the example above into the appropriate regions.
      </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-SetDifference">
    <title>Set Difference</title>

    <p>
      The <term>difference</term> between two sets is like subtraction, but instead of numbers, we remove elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if <m>A = \{1,2,3,4\}</m> and <m>B = \{2,4,5\}</m>, then <m>A - B = \{1,3\}</m> — all the elements in <m>A</m> that are <em>not</em> in <m>B</m>.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-SetDifference">
      <statement>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets. The <term>difference</term> <m>A - B</m> is the set of elements in <m>A</m> that are not in <m>B</m>.
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <exercise>
      <p>
        Let <m>A = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid -3 \le x \le 3\}</m> and <m>B = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x^2 < 9\}</m>. Find <m>A - B</m> and <m>B - A</m>.
