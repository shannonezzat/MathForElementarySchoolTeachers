    <title>Understanding Irrational Numbers</title>
    <p>
      This section explores the concept of irrational numbers, which can be viewed in two ways: decimals that neither repeat nor terminate, or numbers that cannot be written as a fraction (with integer numerator and denominator).

      <title>Examples of Irrational Numbers</title>
      <p>
        Common examples include the number pi (<m>\pi</m>) and certain square roots like <m>\sqrt{2}</m>. While it is outside the scope of this course to show why <m>pi</m> is irrational (the easiest method requires a little bit of calculus, but it is definitely understandable to most 2nd year mathematics students) but we can indeed show that "roots" of integers, which we will define in more detail later, are irrational in almost all cases, and the cases where they are rational numbers only the cases where it is obvious.
      </p>
      <p>Another example is the number <m>n=12.0100100010001 \ldots </m> where the number of zeros preceding the next 1 increases by one each time. Although there is a pattern here, there is no repeating series of decimal digits and we know by Section <xref ref="terminating-repeating-decimals" /> </p>
      <exercise>
        <p>
          Consider the number <m>n</m> in the paragraph above. Can you find another irrational number <m>m</m> so that <m>n+m</m> is a rational number? What about an irrational number <m>k</m> such that <m>n+k</m> is irrational? Finally, is it possible to have a rational number <m>\ell</m> such that <m>n+\ell</m> is rational? Explain (remember that all rational numbers can be expressed as terminating or repeating decimals). 
        </p>
      </exercise>
      <p>
        The set of all rational and irrational numbers together form the set of real numbers, denoted by a blackboard bold R (<m>\mathbb{R}</m>). We can view the sets of numbers we have studied so far in the following Venn diagram. Note that irrational numbers are "negatively defined", as in they are numbers that do not have a certain property. So when we try and show a number is irrational, we usually use a proof by contradiction; that is, we will pretend that the number is rational and show that this leads to a logical fallacy.

    <title>TypesOfIrrationalNumbers</title>
    <p>
      There are many ways to classify irrational numbers, but the most common is to group them according to whether they are solutions to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, like <m>2x^3-4x^2-5=0</m>. We call numbers that are solutions to such equations <term>algebraic numbers</term> and real numbers that are not algebraic we call <term>transcendental numbers</term>. The set of algebraic numbers can be quite complex to understand, so we will focus our attention to a subset of those numbers.
    
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-AlgebraicNumbers">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A real number <m>r \in \mathbb{R}</m> is <term>algebraic</term> if there is a polynomial with integer coefficients for which <m>r</m> is a solution to that polynomial. We call an algebraic number a <term>simple root</term> if it is a solution to a polynomial equation of the form <m>x^n=a</m> for some <m>n \in \mathbb{n}</m> and <m>a \in \mathbb{Z}</m>. We call these solutions <m>n</m>th roots.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Not every polynomial equation has solutions that are real numbers. For example, <m>x^2+1=0</m> has no real solutions, since in order for this equation to be true we need that <m>x^2 &lt; 0,</m> and we know that squaring real numbers gives us a positive number. We could expand our number system to include solutions to equations such as these (called the complex numbers) but this is beyond the scope of the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some famous trancendental numbers are <m>\pi</m>, which is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter, and <m>e,</m> which is a number that is very important in calculus; in short and impresicely, it is a number related to exponential growth, and in fact the function <m>e^x</m> is the only non-zero type of function where the growth rate is always equal to the actual growth. 
    </p>

   <subsection xml:id="subsec-FunctionsBriefly">
    <title>Functions Briefly</title>

    <p>
      In order to talk about simple roots, we need to understand a little bit about functions. A <term>function</term> is a rule that turns an input element into eactly one output element. For example, the rule "add one to a number" can be expressed in the following way: <me>
        f(x)=x+1.
      </me>
      Here, we name the function "add 1 to a number" with the letter <m>f</m>, and <m>x</m> is  the variable we're using to describe the rule using algebra. So if we wanted to add 1 to, say, 5, then we would write <m>f(5)=5+1=6</m>, where we are substituting <m>x=5</m> in to our function <m>f</m>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example above, we could input any real number we like into this function and we get exactly one answer, and this answer makes sense. We call all elements we are allowed to input into our function the <term>domain</term> of our function, and all possible outputs the <m>range</m> of the function. Note that sometimes a function has its domain specified when it is being defined.
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Let's say the rule we want as a function is "multiply a number by itself and add one". If we want to name this rule <m>m</m> we can write <m>m(x)=x^2+1</m>. Here, the function makes sense for any realnumber as an input, so its implied domain is all of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>. Noting that <m>x^2</m> is never negative, and only <m>0</m> when <m>x=0,</m> we can say that the smallest number our function can output is when <m>x=0</m> which makes <m>m(0)=0^2+1=1</m>. So our range is all real numbers greater than or equal to <m>1</m>, or in set notation <m>\{x \in \mathbb{R} \ | \ x \geq 1 \}</m>. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <exercise>
      <p>
        For the following rules, write an algebraic expression for a function. Are there any numbers that cannot be inputted into this function? If so, list them.

        Think about the equation <m>x^2=4</m>. How many solutions does this equation have? We know that <m>2^2=2 \rimes 2=4</m>, but also <m>(-2)^2= (-2) \times (-2) = 4</m>. Notice that since we are multiplying two negative numbers (that happen to be the same number), the result is positive.</p> <p>There is nothing special about the number <m>4</m> here; in fact, this holds for any real number <m>a &gt; 0</m>. We will write this in a theorem.

      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-SquaresAndNegatives">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>a</m> be a positive real number. If a real number <m>k</m> is a solution to <m>x^2=a</m>, then <m>-k</m> is also a solution.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Assume that <m>k</m> is a solution to <m>x^2=a</m>. This means that <m>k^2=a</m>. We need to show that <m>-k</m> is also a solution to <m>x^2=a</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider <m>(-k)^2</m>. Now: <me>(-k)^2=(-k)\times (-k)</me> <me>=[(-1) \times k] \times [(-1) \times k] = [(-1)\times(-1) \times k^2</me> <me>=[1] \times k^2 = 1 \times a = a</me> since we are assuming <m>k^2=a</m>. Thus we have just showed that <m>(-k)^2=a</m> and thus <m>-k</m> is a solution to <m>x^2=a</m> as well.
          </p>
          </proof>
          
      </theorem>
      <p>
        We call solutions to <m>x^2=a</m> <term>square roots</term> of <m>a</m>.   
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          The numbers <m>7</m> and <m>(-7)</m> are square roots of <m>49</m> since <m>7^2=49</m> and <m>(-7)^2=49</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> and <m>-\frac{1}{4}</m> are square roots of <m>\frac{1}{16}</m> since <m>\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2=\frac{1}{16}</m> and <m>\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)^2=\frac{1}{16}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number <m>0</m> is *the* square root of <m>0</m> since <m>0^2=0</m> and also since <m>-0=0</m> there is no other square root.
        </p>
      </example>
      <p>
        We have just shown that if there is a solution to the equation <m>x^2=a</m> then there are two solutions to this equation; the other being its negative. But for any real number <m>a</m>, is there always a solution to <m>x^2=a?</m> 
      </p>
      <exercise>
        <p>
          If <m>a</m> is a negative real number, why is it impossible for <m>x^2=a</m> to have any solutions? What about <m>x^n=a</m> if <m>n</m> is an even natural number?
        </p>
        <hint>
          <p>
            What is the sign of a number (positive/negative/zero) if you multiply two positive numbers? What about two negative numbers? What about 0 with itself? Use this to show that there are no <m>n</m>th roots (for even <m>n</m>) of any negative numbers.

          Using the previous theorem as a model, prove that if <m>n</m> is an even natural number, <m>a</m> is a positive real number, and <m>k</m> is a solution to <m>x^n=a</m> then <m>(-k)</m> is also a solution to <m>x^n=a</m>.

          How do we know that there are at most two square roots? Prove by contradiction that this is impossible. Then modify your proof to show that there are at most two <m>n</m>th powers for an even natural number <m>n</m>.

        Let's explore how many roots there are for odd roots, for example cube roots. Indeed, we'll show that there is exactly one odd root of <m>a</m> for all real numbers <m>a</m>. Let's look at a few examples first:
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          What are all the solutions to <m>x^3=-8</m>? First we realize that <m>x</m> must be negative since we are multiplying <m>x</m> by itself an odd number of times and this results in an odd number. We also know that <m>2^3=8</m>, so we can deduce that <m>x=-2</m> is a solution to <m>x^3=-8</m>.

      <title>nth Powers</title>
      <p>
        For this section, we will deal with the principal root of natural numbers, but these results also hold for other roots, if they exist. We will show this in the following section.
      </p>
    <p>
      In this chapter we will work towards showing that the only <m>n</m>th roots that are not irrational are those that are <m>n</m>th powers. We'll show that every other <m>n</m>th root cannot be written as a rational number by contradiction; we'll try to, and then show that two quantities that should be equal cannot be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to show this, we'll first have to prove a property about <m>n</m>th powers; indeed, that they are exacly numbers where each prime in its prime factorization has an exponent with a factor of <m>n</m>. Let's do some examples to illustrate this:
    </p>
    

    <example>
      <p>
        Consider <m>s=144</m>. We know that <m>144</m> has a prime factorization of <m>144=2^4 \dot 3^2</m>. And since the exponents <m>4</m> and <m>2</m> are both even (have a factor of 2) then we can use our exponent rules and write <m>144 = 2^4 \dot 3^2 = (2^2 \dot 3)^2=12^2</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we know that <m>72=2^3 \dot 3^2</m> is not a square number since there is one of the exponents that is not even. So there is no way to "factor out" a <m>2</m> from each exponent. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's show this in general for any square and non-square number. 
      </p>
    </example>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-SquareEvenExponents">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be a natural number.  The number <m>m</m> is a square number if and only if each exponent of its prime factorization has a factor of <m>2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Assume <m>m</m> is a square number. Then <m>m=a^2</m> for some natural number <m>a</m>. Since <m>a</m> is a natural number it has a prime factorization, say <m>a=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\ldots p_k^{e_k}.</m>. Then <m>m=a^2 = (p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\ldots p_k^{e_k})^2=</m> and thus each exponent of the primes in the prime factorization of <m>n</m> has a factor of <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now assume that every exponent in the prime factorization of <m>m</m> is even. Thus <m>m=p_1^{2e_1}p_2^{2e_2}\ldots p_k^{2e_k} = (p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\ldots p_k^{e_k})^2=</m>. This means that the number <m>a = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\ldots p_k^{e_k} </m> is such that <m>a^2=m</m> and this means that <m>m</m> is a square number.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Now that we've shown this for square numbers, can you work out how to generalize this for any <m>n</m>th power?
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <p>
        Modify the proof above to prove the result "The number <m>m</m> is an <m>n</m>th power if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization has a factor of <m>n</m>".
      </p>
     
    </exercise>
    <p> Remember that if we have a conditional statement "if P then Q" it is logically equivalent to its contrapositiveL "if not Q then not P". Thus we can express a biconditional as "If P then Q *and* if not P then not Q". We can rewite the result in the exercise above to be the following theorem that will be very useful for us:
    <theorem xml:id="thm-nthPower">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>m</m> be a natural number. If <m>m</m> is an <m>n</m>th power then each exponent in its prime factorization has a factor of <m>n</m>. If <m>m</m> is not an <m>n</m>th power, then there is a prime number in its prime factorization whith an exponent with no factor of <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
      
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Consider <m>m=5400</m>. You can check that the prime factorization of <m>m</m> is <m>m=2^3 \dot 3^3 \dot 5^2</m>. Since the prime <m>5</m> has an exponent that is not divisible by 3, we know that <m>5400</m> is not a cube (3rd power).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if <m>m=27000=2^3 \dot 3^3 \dot 5^3</m> we know that <m>m</m> is indeed a cube, and <m>m=(2\dot 3 \dot 5)^3 = 30^3</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-ProvingIrrationalityofnthRoots">
    <title>Proving Irrationality of nth Roots</title>
    <p>
      Note that in this section we will assume that the set of natural numbers includes 0. We will now work on proving what we set out to prove: that all <m>n</m>th roots of numbers that are not <m>n</m>th powers are indeed irrational. A key result that we will use to help us is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every natural number has a unique prime factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's first explore the more general case with square roots:
    </p>
    <example>
      <p>
        Let <m>n</m> be a non-square number. This means that in its prime factorization, there is at least one prime that has a power that isn't a multiple of <m>2</m>. For example, if <m>n=60=2^2 \times 3 \times 5</m>. Here both <m>3</m> and <m>5</m> have an exponent of one, which isn't a multiple of <m>2</m>. We'll pick the smallest of these primes with such an exponent and call that prime <m>p_*</m> with exponent <m>2e_*+1</m> for some  <m>e_* \in \mathbb{N}_0</m> and we can write <m>n=p_*^{2e_*+1}k</m> where <m>k</m> is the "rest" of the factors of <m>n</m>. In our example, <m>p_*=3</m> and <m>e_*=1</m> and <m>60=3^1 \times (2^2 \times 5)</m> and thus <m>k=2^2 \times 5</m> in this example. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We will show this by contradiction; let's pretend that we can indeed write <m>\sqrt{n}</m> as a rational number: <m>\sqrt{n}=\frac{a}{b}</m> for some appropriate integers <m>a,b</m>. In our example, we let <m>\sqrt{60}=\frac{a}{b}</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's arrange our equation so that we have no roots or denominators: this means multiplying both sides by <m>b</m> and then squaring both sides of the equation:
        <me>
          \sqrt{n}=\frac{a}{b} \rightarrow \sqrt{n}b=a \rightarrow nb^2=a^2.
        </me> In our example:
        <me>\sqrt{60}=\frac{a}{b} \rightarrow \sqrt{60}b=a \rightarrow 60b^2=a^2. </me>
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's count the number of factors of <m>p_*</m> on both sides of the equation. On the RHS, by <xref ref="thm-nthPower"/> we know that <m>a^2</m> has an even number of <m>p_*</m>, and thus the exponent <m>e</m> of <m>p_*</m> in the prime factorization of <m>b^2</m> is a factor of <m>2</m>, so say <m>e=2r</m> for some natural numnber <m>r</m>. So <m>b^2=p_*^{2r}j</m> where <m>j</m> are the "rest" of the factors of <m>n</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, on the LHS, by <xref ref="thm-nthPower"/> we also know that <m>b^2</m> has an even exponent for <m>p_*</m> in it's prime factorization, say <m>2s</m> for some natural number <m>s</m> and similarly to <m>a^2</m> we can say <m>b^2=p_*^{2s}\ell</m> for some integer <m>ell</m>, while <m>n</m> itself has an odd exponent for <m>p_*</m>. Thus 
        <me>
          nb^2 = (p_*^{2e_*+1}k)(p_*^{2s}\ell) = p_*^{2e_*+1+2s}k\ell = p_*^{2(e_*+s)+1}kl.
        </me>
        In our example:
        <me>
          60b^2 = (3^{1} (2^2 \times 5))(3^{2s}\ell) = 3^{2s+1}[(2^2 \times 5)\ell].
        </me>
       
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting this together:
        <me>p_*^{2(e_*+s)+1}kl = p_*^{2r}j.  </me>
      </p> However, the exponent of <m>p_*</m> on the LHS is not a multiple of <m>2</m> while the exponent on the RHS is (this is true in our example too). So the only way that we can write <m>\sqrt{n}</m> as a rational number is if we can have an even and odd exponent of <m>p_*</m> in the prime factorization of <m>n</m>. But we know it must be one or the other since prime factorizations are unique by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. So this is a contradiction, and what we started with must be incorrect; that is, we cannot write <m>\sqrt{n}</m> as a rational number.

        <p>
          You should count the number of <m>2</m>s on the LHS and RHS of the rearranged expression like in the theorem above.

          <hint>
            <p>
              If a number is not a cube (or 3rd power), this means that there is at least one prime, say <m>p_*</m> in its prime factorization with an exponent, say <m>e</m> that is not a multiple of <m>3</m>. So <m>e=3e_*+c</m> where <m>c</m> is a proper remainder (in this case, either 1 or 2).

          </hint>
          <hint>
            <p>
              This means that <m>p_*=2</m> and <m>e=1</m> here.
            </p>
          </hint>
          <hint>
            <p>
              You will want to count the number of <m>2</m>s on both sides of the equation when rearranged appropriately.

        <title>Addition and Subtraction with Irrational Numbers</title>
        <p>
          As a reminder, when we add two rational numbers, the result is also a rational number. This is known as the closure property of addition for rational numbers. Formally, if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are rational numbers, then <m>a + b</m> and <m>a - b</m> are also rational numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we can show that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is always irrational. Let's state this formally as a theorem and prove it by contradiction.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm_rat_plus_irr_irr">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Let <m>r</m> be a rational number and <m>i</m> be an irrational number. Then <m>r + i</m> is irrational.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <proof>
            <p>
              Assume for the sake of contradiction that <m>r + i</m> is a rational number. Since the set of rational numbers is closed under addition and subtraction, we can write:
            </p>
            <p>
              <m>r + i = q</m> where <m>q</m> is a rational number.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can then subtract <m>r</m> from both sides of the equation:
            </p>
            <p>
              <m>i = q - r</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since both <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> are rational numbers, and the difference of two rational numbers is also rational, <m>q - r</m> must be rational.
            </p>
            <p>
              This implies that <m>i</m> is rational, which contradicts our initial assumption that <m>i</m> is irrational. Therefore, our assumption that <m>r + i</m> is rational must be false, and <m>r + i</m> is indeed irrational.
            </p>
          </proof>
        </theorem>
        <p>
          It is important to note that while the sum of a finite number of rational numbers is rational, the sum of infinitely many rational numbers can be irrational. This can be understood by considering the decimal expansion of certain numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the number <m>\pi</m> (pi) is known to be irrational. Its decimal expansion is non-repeating and non-terminating:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\pi = 3.141592653589793238...</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          If we express <m>\pi</m> as the sum of its decimal parts, we get an infinite series of rational numbers:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\pi = 3 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.001 +0.0005 + 0.00009 + 0.000002 + \ldots</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each term in this series is a rational number, but their infinite sum converges to the irrational number <m>\pi</m>. This demonstrates that the sum of infinitely many rational numbers can indeed be irrational.
        </p>
        <p>
          When adding two irrational numbers, the result can be either rational or irrational. Let's explore this with two examples:
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Consider the irrational numbers <m>\sqrt{2}+1</m>, which we know is irrational by Theorem <xref ref="thm_rat_plus_irr_irr"/>, and <m>-\sqrt{2}</m>. Their sum is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>\sqrt{2}+1 + (-\sqrt{2}) = 1</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, <m>1</m> is a rational number. Thus in this example the sum of two irrational numbers is a rational number.
          </p>
        </example>
        <example>
          <p>
            Now, consider the irrational numbers <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3}</m>. Their sum is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sum is still an irrational number because there is no way to express it as a ratio of two integers; we will justify this claim in the following section.
          </p>
        </example>
        <p>
          We can summarize the possible results of adding or subtracting rational and irrational numbers in the following table:

            Consider the number <m>\sqrt{2}</m>. Show that <m>\sqrt{2} + 1</m> and <m>\sqrt{2} - 1</m> are both irrational.
          </p>
          <solution>
            <p>
              Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that <m>\sqrt{2} + 1</m> is rational. Then we can write:
            </p>
            <p>
              <m>\sqrt{2} + 1 = r</m> for some rational number <m>r</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
            </p>
            <p>
              <m>\sqrt{2} = r - 1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <m>r</m> is rational, <m>r - 1</m> is also rational, implying that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational, which is a contradiction. Hence, <m>\sqrt{2} + 1</m> is irrational.
            </p>
            <p>
              A similar argument shows that <m>\sqrt{2} - 1</m> is irrational by assuming it is rational and arriving at a contradiction that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> would be rational.

      <title>Multiplication and Division with Irrational Numbers</title>
      <p>
        Multiplication and division of irrational numbers shares many of the same properties as addition does, as explored above. The biggest difference is keeping in mind that multiplying by 0 is a special case; we always know that multiplying by 0 gives us 0. Also, remember that division by 0 is something that is not defined.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As a reminder, when we multiply two rational numbers, the result is also a rational number. This is known as the closure property of multiplication for rational numbers. Formally, if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are rational numbers, then <m>a \times b</m> is also a rational number.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, similar to addition, we can show that the product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is always irrational. Let's state this formally as a theorem and prove it by contradiction.
      </p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm_rat_times_irr_irr">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>r</m> be a non-zero rational number and <m>i</m> be an irrational number. Then <m>r \times i</m> is irrational.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Assume for the sake of contradiction that <m>r \times i</m> is a rational number. Since the set of rational numbers is closed under multiplication and division, we can write:
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>r \times i = q</m> where <m>q</m> is a rational number.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can then divide both sides of the equation by <m>r</m> (since <m>r \neq 0</m>):
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>i = \frac{q}{r}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since both <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> are rational numbers, and the quotient of two rational numbers is also rational, <m>\frac{q}{r}</m> must be rational.
          </p>
          <p>
            This implies that <m>i</m> is rational, which contradicts our initial assumption that <m>i</m> is irrational. Therefore, our assumption that <m>r \times i</m> is rational must be false, and <m>r \times i</m> is indeed irrational.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        Note that multiplying any number by zero always results in zero, which is rational. Thus, the product of zero and any irrational number is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that while the product of a finite number of rational numbers is rational, the product of infinitely many rational numbers can be irrational. This can be understood by considering the Wallis product for <m>\pi</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wallis product for <m>\pi</m> is an infinite product of rational numbers that converges to the irrational number <m>\pi</m>. Showing that the product below converges to <m>\pi</m> is slightly beyond the scope of this book, but you can explore this yourself by looking at "partial" products and continuing to multiply by succesive terms. You should notice that these partial products get closer and closer to <m>\pi</m>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>\frac{\pi}{2} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2n}{2n-1}\times \frac{2n}{2n+1} = \left(\frac{2}{1} \times \frac{2}{3}\right) \times \left(\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{4}{5}\right) \times \left(\frac{6}{5} \times \frac{6}{7}\right) \times \ldots</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each factor in this product is a rational number, but the infinite product converges to the irrational number <m>\pi</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When multiplying two non-zero irrational numbers, the result can be either rational or irrational. Let's explore this with two examples:
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          Consider the irrational numbers <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m>. We know the second of these numbers is irrational by Theorem <xref ref="thm_rat_times_irr_irr"/>. Their product is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\sqrt{2} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, the product of two irrational numbers is a rational number (1).
        </p>
      </example>
      <example>
        <p>
          Now, consider the irrational numbers <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>\sqrt{5}</m>. Their product is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{5} = \sqrt{10}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This product is still an irrational number which we know is irrational since it is a square root of a non-square number.

      <title>More Elaborate Examples of Irrationality</title>
      <p>
        Sometimes, demonstrating that a number is irrational can be more challenging and require more sophisticated techniques. In this subsection, we will explore some harder examples to illustrate these methods.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Let's begin by showing that <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is irrational. We will do this by assuming that it is rational and then squaring the expression to arrive at a contradiction.
      </p>
      
      <example>
        <p>
          Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is rational. Then we can write:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} = r\) for some rational number \(r\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
          \((\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})^2 = r^2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Expanding the left-hand side, we have:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\sqrt{2}^2 + 2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3}^2 = r^2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Simplifying, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(2 + 2\sqrt{6} + 3 = r^2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining like terms, we obtain:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(5 + 2\sqrt{6} = r^2\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since \(r\) is rational, \(r^2\) is also rational. Therefore, \(5 + 2\sqrt{6}\) must be rational. However, we know that \(2\sqrt{6}\) is irrational because \(\sqrt{6}\) is irrational (as 6 is not a square number).
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, \(5 + 2\sqrt{6}\) is a sum of a rational number (5) and an irrational number (\(2\sqrt{6}\)), which is irrational. This contradicts our assumption that \(5 + 2\sqrt{6}\) is rational. Therefore, \(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\) must be irrational.
        </p>
      </example>
      
      <p>
        Next, we will show that <m>\sqrt[3]{2} \times \sqrt{3}</m> is irrational by assuming it is rational and then solving for 2 to reach a contradiction.
      </p>
      
      <example>
        <p>
          Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that \(\sqrt[3]{2} \times \sqrt{3}\) is rational. Then we can write:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\sqrt[3]{2} \times \sqrt{3} = r\) for some rational number \(r\).
        </p>
        <p>
          We can cube both sides of the equation to remove the cube root:
        </p>
        <p>
          \((\sqrt[3]{2} \times \sqrt{3})^3 = r^3\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Expanding the left-hand side, we have:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(\sqrt[3]{2}^3 \times \sqrt{3}^3 = r^3\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Simplifying, we get:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(2 \times 3\sqrt{3} = r^3\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining the constants, we obtain:
        </p>
        <p>
          \(6\sqrt{3} = r^3\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since \(r\) is rational, \(r^3\) is also rational. Therefore, \(6\sqrt{3}\) must be rational. However, we know that \(\sqrt{3}\) is irrational.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, \(6\sqrt{3}\) is a product of a rational number (6) and an irrational number (\(\sqrt{3}\)), which is irrational. This contradicts our assumption that \(6\sqrt{3}\) is rational. Therefore, \(\sqrt[3]{2} \times \sqrt{3}\) must be irrational.

      <p>
        An <m>n</m>th root of a number can be represented as raising the number to the power of <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>. This means that for any positive real number <m>a</m> and any natural number <m>n</m>, the expression <m>\sqrt[n]{a}</m> is equivalent to <m>a^{\frac{1}{n}}</m>. To understand this, consider that raising <m>a^{\frac{1}{n}}</m> to the power of <m>n</m> gives us back the original number:
      </p>
      <me>
        \left(a^{\frac{1}{n}}\right)^n = a

          \left(4^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 = 4

      <title>Multiplying and Dividing nth Roots</title>
      <p>
        When working with roots, we can multiply or divide nth roots, but we cannot add or subtract them in a straightforward manner. The rules for multiplying and dividing roots come from the properties of exponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, to simplify the product of two square roots, we use the property that:
      </p>
      <me>
        \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \times b}
      </me>
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{8}</m>:
        </p>
        <me>
          \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{8} = \sqrt{2 \times 8} = \sqrt{16} = 4
        </me>
      </example>
      <p>
        The same applies to division:
      </p>
      <me>
        \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}
      </me>
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>\frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}}</m>:
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{2}} = \sqrt{9} = 3
        </me>
      </example>
      <p>
        However, adding or subtracting roots is not as straightforward. For example, <m>\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}</m> does not equal <m>\sqrt{a + b}</m>.
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16}</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\sqrt{9} + \sqrt{16} = 3 + 4 = 7</m>, but <m>\sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5</m>, which is different.

      <title>Simplifying Expressions with Fractional Powers</title>
      <p>
        Simplifying expressions containing fractional powers often involves using the properties of exponents. Understanding these properties is crucial for algebraic manipulation and solving various mathematical problems efficiently. Also, it allows us to see the relationship between multiplication of numbers with the same base, and addition of their exponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        When working with fractional powers, it's important to remember that the numerator of the fraction represents the power, and the denominator represents the root. For example, \(a^{\frac{m}{n}}\) can be interpreted as the nth root of \(a\) raised to the mth power, as in <m>(a^{m})^{1/n}</m> or as the nth root of mth power of <m>a</m>, as in <m>(a^{1/n})^m</m>. This dual interpretation is helpful when simplifying or transforming expressions.
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>a^{\frac{1}{2}} \times a^{\frac{1}{2}}</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the property of exponents that <m>a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}</m>, we get:
        </p>
        <me>
          a^{\frac{1}{2}} \times a^{\frac{1}{2}} = a^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} = a^1 = a
        </me>
        <p>
          This example demonstrates that multiplying two expressions with the same base and fractional exponents involves simply adding the exponents. Here, since \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\), the result is \(a^1\), which simplifies to \(a\).
        </p>
      </example>
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>\left(b^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^3</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the property of exponents that <m>\left(a^m\right)^n = a^{m \times n}</m>, we get:
        </p>
        <me>
          \left(b^{\frac{1}{3}}\right)^3 = b^{\frac{1}{3} \times 3} = b^1 = b
        </me>
        <p>
          This example shows how raising a power to another power results in multiplying the exponents. Here, \(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1\), so the expression simplifies to \(b^1\), which is simply \(b\).
        </p>
      </example>
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>\left(\frac{c^{\frac{1}{4}}}{d^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)^2</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the property of exponents that <m>\left(\frac{a^m}{b^n}\right)^p = \frac{a^{m \times p}}{b^{n \times p}}</m>, we get:
        </p>
        <me>
          \left(\frac{c^{\frac{1}{4}}}{d^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right)^2 = \frac{c^{\frac{1}{4} \times 2}}{d^{\frac{1}{2} \times 2}} = \frac{c^{\frac{2}{4}}}{d^1} = \frac{c^{\frac{1}{2}}}{d}
        </me>
        <p>
          This example illustrates the application of the exponent rule to a fraction. By raising both the numerator and the denominator to the power of 2, we multiply their respective exponents by 2, allowing us to simplify the expression.
        </p>
      </example>
      <p>
        To further deepen our understanding, let's consider a more complex example involving a sum and product of fractional powers:
      </p>
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>(x^{\frac{1}{2}} \times y^{\frac{1}{3}}) \times (x^{\frac{1}{2}} \times y^{\frac{2}{3}})</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the properties of exponents, we combine like terms:
        </p>
        <me>
          (x^{\frac{1}{2}} \times y^{\frac{1}{3}}) \times (x^{\frac{1}{2}} \times y^{\frac{2}{3}}) = x^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}} \times y^{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}} = x^1 \times y^1 = xy
        </me>
        <p>
          This example combines both addition of exponents and multiplication of terms with fractional powers. By adding the exponents of \(x\) and \(y\) separately, we simplify the expression to \(xy\).
        </p>
      </example>
      
      <example>
        <p>
          Simplify <m>\frac{(a^2b^{-1})^{\frac{1}{2}}}{b^3c^{-2}} \div \left(\frac{a^2b^2c^{-1}}{(a^{-1}c)^{-1}}\right)^2</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, simplify each part of the expression separately:
        </p>
        <me>
          (a^2b^{-1})^{\frac{1}{2}} = a^{2 \times \frac{1}{2}} b^{-1 \times \frac{1}{2}} = a^1 b^{-\frac{1}{2}} = ab^{-\frac{1}{2}}
        </me>
        <p>
          <m>\frac{1}{b^3c^{-2}} = b^{-3}c^2</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\left(\frac{a^2b^2c^{-1}}{(a^{-1}c)^{-1}}\right)^2</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
          Simplify the denominator:
        </p>
        <me>
          (a^{-1}c)^{-1} = a^1c^{-1} = ac^{-1}
        </me>
        <p>
          Now the expression inside the parenthesis becomes:
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{a^2b^2c^{-1}}{ac^{-1}} = a^{2-1}b^2c^{-1+1} = ab^2
        </me>
        <p>
          Squaring this, we get:
        </p>
        <me>
          (ab^2)^2 = a^2b^4
        </me>
        <p>
          Now combine all parts:
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{ab^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{b^{-3}c^2} \div a^2b^4 = \frac{ab^{-\frac{1}{2}} \times c^2}{b^{-3}} \div a^2b^4
        </me>
        <p>
          Simplify the multiplication:
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{ab^{-\frac{1}{2}} \times b^3 \times c^2}{a^2b^4} = \frac{ab^{3-\frac{1}{2}}c^2}{a^2b^4} = \frac{ab^{\frac{5}{2}}c^2}{a^2b^4}
        </me>
        <p>
          Now combine the exponents:
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{ab^{\frac{5}{2}}c^2}{a^2b^4} = \frac{ac^2}{a^2b^{4-\frac{5}{2}}} = \frac{ac^2}{a^2b^{\frac{3}{2}}} = \frac{c^2}{ab^{\frac{3}{2}}}
