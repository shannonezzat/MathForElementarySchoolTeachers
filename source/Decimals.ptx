    <title>Introduction to Decimals</title>
    <p>We're going to move on and start discussing decimals. Now, decimals really are fractions, and this section will help us understand why and how. We use decimal notation since the behaviour of decimal fractions is very similar to the behaviour of integers in our base ten nuber system.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="decimal-fractions">
        <title>Decimal Fractions</title>
        <p>A <term>decimal fraction</term> is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10. More formally, a decimal fraction is a rational number <m>\frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{R}</m> where <m>b=10^k</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. This means the denominators of these fractions are all multiples of 10, which makes them behave a lot like the way our place values to the left of the decimal point operate. In base 10, a <term>unit decimal fraction</term> has 1 as the numerator.</p>

            <subsubsection>
  <title>Decimal Fractions and Their Relationship to Whole Numbers</title>
  <p>
    Decimal fractions are a way of expressing quantities that are smaller than a whole unit. In our base-ten number system, each place value to the right of the decimal point represents a fraction of the whole unit. The first digit after the decimal point represents tenths (1/10), the second digit represents hundredths (1/100), and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    An interesting aspect of decimal fractions is the similarity they share with whole numbers. We know that multiplying a whole number by 10 raises its place value by 1, such as multiplying 10 by 10<sup>k</sup> gives us 10<sup>k+1</sup>. In a similar manner, multiplying a decimal fraction by 10 also shifts its place value to the left. For example, multiplying 1/10<sup>k</sup> by 10 gives us 1/10<sup>k-1</sup>. This relationship holds true as we move along the decimal places and will allow us to perform arithmetic operations similarly to arithmetic with whole numbers.

            <statement>
                <p>Examples of decimal fractions are 3/10, 671/1000, -55/1000000, and 372/100.</p>

        <title>Representation of Decimals</title>
        <p>Decimals are fractions in disguise. Let's look at the number 32.329. This can be written as 32 + 3/10 + 2/100 + 9/1000, but it can also be written in many other forms using decimal fractions.</p>

        <example xml:id="decimal-representation-example1">

            <solution>
                <p>32.329 can be written as 32329/1000, using the denominator of the smallest decimal place in our number.</p>
                 <p> We can also write 32.329 writing the non-decimal part as a whole number and the decimal part using the smallest decimal place value: 32+329/1000. </p>

        <title>Comparing Decimals</title>
        <p>To compare decimals, make them have a common denominator. This can be done by ensuring they have the same number of places to the right of the decimal point, and then comparing as normal.</p>

        <example xml:id="comparing-decimals-example1">
            <statement>
                <p>Compare 0.32 and 0.6.</p>

            <solution>
                <p>0.32 is 32 hundredths, and 0.6 can be written as 0.60, which represents 60 hundredths. Therefore, 0.60 is larger than 0.32.</p>

    <title>Operations with Decimals</title>
    <p>In this section, we will explore the four basic operations with decimals: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We will not only practice these operations but also understand why they work the way they do.</p>

        <title>Addition and Subtraction with Decimals</title>
        <p>Adding and subtracting decimals is straightforward because decimal fractions behave the same as place value. The key is to line up your place values (digits) and add or subtract right to left, carrying to the next place if necessary.</p>

    <title>Terminating and Repeating Decimals</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
        In this section, our goal is to understand the relationship between rational numbers and their decimal representations. Specifically, we aim to show that a rational number is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction. Conversely, a rational number is equivalent to a repeating decimal if and only if it is not equivalent to a decimal fraction. This understanding is crucial for elementary school mathematics teachers as it forms the basis for many mathematical operations and concepts.
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="terminating-decimals">
    <title>Terminating Decimals</title>
    <p>
        A <term>terminating decimal</term> is a decimal number that has a finite number of digits. In other words, it is a decimal that ends or "terminates". It can be expressed as a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-terminating-decimal">
        <title>Examples of Terminating Decimals</title>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of fractions that are equivalent to terminating decimals:
            <itemize>
                <item>1/2 = 0.5: Here, we can say that 1/2 is equivalent to the fraction 5/10. </item>
                <item>3/4 = 0.75: When we divide 3 by 4, we get 0.75, which is a terminating decimal.</item>
                <item>7/8 = 0.875: Dividing 7 by 8 gives us 0.875, another terminating decimal.</item>
                <item>3/15 = 0.2: Even though 15 is not a power of 10, it is equivalent to a fraction that is; the fraction 3/15 simplifies to 1/5, and this is equivalent to the decimal fraction 20/100, and thus a terminating decimal.</item>
            </itemize>
        </p>
        <p>
            And here are examples of how to write a terminating decimal as a fraction:
            <itemize>
                <item>0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2: Here, we express 0.5 as the fraction 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.</item>
                <item>0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4: We can express 0.75 as the fraction 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4.</item>
                <item>0.875 = 875/1000 = 7/8: The decimal 0.875 can be expressed as the fraction 875/1000, which simplifies to 7/8.</item>
                <item>0.2 = 2/10 = 1/5: The decimal 0.2 can be expressed as the fraction 2/10, which simplifies to 1/5.</item>
            </itemize>
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
        Now, let's prove that a rational number is equivalent to a terminating decimal* if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.
    </p>
    <assemblage>*Note: this is not quite correct, as we'll see later that decimals that have repeating 9s to the right are equivalent to terminating decimals. We will discuss this in more depth later.</assemblage>
    <proof xml:id="proof-terminating-decimal">
        <title>Proof</title>
        <p>
            Since this is an "if and only if" statement in the form <m>P \leftrightarrow Q</m>, we have to prove two results, <m>P \rightarrow Q</m> and <m>Q \rightarrow P</m>.  Let's denote a rational number as a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. We want to show that a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal. Then, by definition of a terminating decimal, a/b can be written as a decimal with a finite number of digits. This means that a/b can be expressed as a decimal fraction, because a decimal fraction is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10, and any terminating decimal can be expressed in this form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, suppose a/b is equivalent to a decimal fraction. Then a/b can be expressed as a decimal with a finite number of digits, because a decimal fraction is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10, and any fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10 can be expressed as a terminating decimal. Therefore, a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting both results together, a rational number is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.
        </p>
    </proof>
    <p>Let's look at a non-example; 7/15. Since <m>15=3 \times 5</m> and 3 and 7 share no common factors, there is no way of "cancelling" the factor of 3 in the denominator. Thus there is nothing we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by so that both are still integers and the denominator does not have a factor of 3, and thus it isn't equivalent to a decimal fraction, which has denominators of the form <m>10^k=2^k5^k</m>.</p> 
</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="repeating-decimals-long-division">
    <title>Expressing a Fraction as a Repeating Decimal Using Long Division</title>
    <p>
        If a fraction is not equivalent to a decimal fraction, it can be expressed as a repeating decimal. One way to do this is by using long division. During this process, we may notice that we "run out" of non-zero remainders before the remainders must repeat, indicating a repeating decimal.
    </p>
    <p>Why is this the case? Well, imagine you are dividing <m>a</m> by some non-zero integer <m>b</m>. There are only finitely many possible remainders: <m>\{0,1,2, \ldots, b-2, b-1 \}</m>.  </p>
        <p>Now, we can convert a fraction a/b to its decimal representation by long division. If we do get a reminder of 0, then we know that the decimal is a terminating decimal. So imagine that a/b cannot be expressed as a terminating decimal. Then we will never see the remainder 0, and thus we only have <m>b-1</m> possible remainders when performing each partial division in the long division algorithm. Note that we can add as many zeros to the right (after the decimal and after all non-zero decimal digits); e.g. 20.201 = 20.2010000... Let's call these the <term>trailing zeroes.</term> </p>
    <p>Now when we get to using the place values of the trailing zeros, every time we "bring down" a digit from a new place value, that digit will be 0. If, at this point, we keep track of remainders, we note that we have at most <m>b-1</m> unique remainders before one must repeat. At the point of repetition, our "previous work" will repeat over and over again, since we will only end up in situations we have seen before and thus the digits of decimal representation of our fraction between the repeated remainders will repeat over and over again to the right. Thus, we know that if fraction is not equivalent to a terminating decimal, it must be a repeating decimal.</p>
    <example xml:id="example-long-division-2-7">
        <title>Example: Expressing 2/7 as a Repeating Decimal Using Long Division</title>
        <p>
            Let's express the fraction 2/7 as a repeating decimal using long division.
            <ol>
                <li>Divide 2 by 7. Since 2 is less than 7, we add a decimal point and a zero to the right of 2, making it 20.</li>
                <li>Now, divide 20 by 7. The result is 2 with a remainder of 6.</li>
                <li>Add another zero to the right of the remainder, making it 60.</li>
                <li>Divide 60 by 7. The result is 8 with a remainder of 4.</li>
                <li>Repeat this process. Each time, we add a zero to the right of the remainder and divide by 7.</li>
                <li>Eventually, we notice that the remainders start to repeat (and must repeat, since there are only a finite number of remainders), indicating a repeating decimal.</li>
            </ol>
            So, 2/7 = 0.<m>\overline{285714}</m>.

                <li>Add another zero to the right of the remainder, making it 80.</li>
                <li>Divide 80 by 13. The result is 6 with a remainder of 2.</li>

                <li>Let x = 0.<m>\overline{27}</m>.</li>
                <li>The period of the repetend is 2, so p = 2.</li>
                <li>Calculate (10^p)x - x = 100x - x = 99x. In decimal form, this is 27.2727... - 0.2727... = 27.</li>
                <li>Solve for x: x = 27/99.</li>
                <li>Convert the numerator and denominator to integers by multiplying both by 1 (no need to clear decimal places in this case).</li>
                <li>Simplify by converting the fraction to lowest terms: x = 3/11.</li>
            </ol>
            So, the repeating decimal 0.<m>\overline{27}</m> is equal to the fraction 3/11.

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Convert 0.5 to a fraction:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Let x = 0.5. Notice that this is a terminating decimal, not a repeating decimal. However, we can still use our method to convert it to a fraction.</li>
                        <li>Since there's no repetend, we can say p = 0.</li>
                        <li>Calculate (10^p)x - x = x - x = 0. In decimal form, this is 0.5 - 0.5 = 0.</li>
                        <li>Solve for x: x = 0/1.</li>
                        <li>Convert the numerator and denominator to integers by multiplying both by 1 (no need to clear decimal places in this case).</li>
                        <li>Simplify by converting the fraction to lowest terms: x = 0.</li>
                    </ol>
                    So, the decimal 0.5 is equal to the fraction 1/2.
