            <title>Decimal Fractions and Their Relationship to Whole Numbers</title>
    <p>We're going to move on and start discussing decimals. Now, decimals really are fractions, and this section will help us understand why and how. We use decimal notation since the behaviour of decimal fractions is very similar to the behaviour of integers in our base ten nuber system.</p>

    
        <p>A <term>decimal fraction</term> is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10. More formally, a decimal fraction is a rational number <m>\frac{a}{b} \in \mathbb{R}</m> where <m>b=10^k</m> for some <m>k \in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. This means the denominators of these fractions are all multiples of 10, which makes them behave a lot like the way our place values to the left of the decimal point operate. In base 10, a <term>unit decimal fraction</term> has 1 as the numerator.</p>

            
  <p>
    Decimal fractions are a way of expressing quantities that are smaller than a whole unit. In our base-ten number system, each place value to the right of the decimal point represents a fraction of the whole unit. The first digit after the decimal point represents tenths (1/10), the second digit represents hundredths (1/100), and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    An interesting aspect of decimal fractions is the similarity they share with whole numbers. We know that multiplying a whole number by 10 raises its place value by 1, such as multiplying 10 by <m>10^k</m> gives us <m>10^{k+1}</m>. In a similar manner, dividing a decimal fraction by 10 also shifts its place value to the left. For example, dividing <m>(1/10^)k</m> by 10 gives us <m>(1/10)^{k-1}</m>. This relationship holds true as we move along the decimal places and will allow us to perform arithmetic operations similarly to arithmetic with whole numbers.

        <example xml:id="decimal-fraction-example1">
            <statement>
                <p>Examples of decimal fractions are 3/10, 671/1000, -55/1000000, and 372/100.</p>
            </statement>
        </example>
        
        <p>When we add up ten unit decimal fractions, we get a unit fraction of the next largest kind. If we add up ten hundredths, we get one tenth.</p>

        <title>Representation of Decimals</title>
        <p>Decimals are fractions in disguise. Let's look at the number 32.329. This can be written as 32 + 3/10 + 2/100 + 9/1000, but it can also be written in many other forms using decimal fractions.</p>

        <example xml:id="decimal-representation-example1">

            <solution>
                <p>32.329 can be written as 32329/1000, using the denominator of the smallest decimal place in our number.</p>
                 <p> We can also write 32.329 writing the non-decimal part as a whole number and the decimal part using the smallest decimal place value: 32+329/1000. </p>

        <title>Comparing Decimals</title>
        <p>To compare decimals, make them have a common denominator. This can be done by ensuring they have the same number of places to the right of the decimal point, and then comparing as normal.</p>

        <example xml:id="comparing-decimals-example1">

            <solution>
                <p>0.32 is 32 hundredths, and 0.6 can be written as 0.60, which represents 60 hundredths. Therefore, 0.60 is larger than 0.32.</p>

    <title>Terminating and Repeating Decimals</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
        In this section, our goal is to understand the relationship between rational numbers and their decimal representations. Specifically, we aim to show that a rational number is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction. Conversely, a rational number is equivalent to a repeating decimal if and only if it is not equivalent to a decimal fraction. This understanding is crucial for elementary school mathematics teachers as it forms the basis for many mathematical operations and concepts.
    </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="terminating-decimals">
    <title>Terminating Decimals</title>
    <p>
        A <term>terminating decimal</term> is a decimal number that has a finite number of digits. In other words, it is a decimal that ends or "terminates". It can be expressed as a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-terminating-decimal">
        <title>Examples of Terminating Decimals</title>
        <p>
            Here are some examples of fractions that are equivalent to terminating decimals:
            <ol>
                <li>1/2 = 0.5: Here, we can say that 1/2 is equivalent to the fraction 5/10. </li>
                <li>3/4 = 0.75: When we divide 3 by 4, we get 0.75, which is a terminating decimal.</li>
                <li>7/8 = 0.875: Dividing 7 by 8 gives us 0.875, another terminating decimal.</li>
                <li>3/15 = 0.2: Even though 15 is not a power of 10, it is equivalent to a fraction that is; the fraction 3/15 simplifies to 1/5, and this is equivalent to the decimal fraction 20/100, and thus a terminating decimal.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            And here are examples of how to write a terminating decimal as a fraction:
            <ol>
                <li>0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2: Here, we express 0.5 as the fraction 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.</li>
                <li>0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4: We can express 0.75 as the fraction 75/100, which simplifies to 3/4.</li>
                <li>0.875 = 875/1000 = 7/8: The decimal 0.875 can be expressed as the fraction 875/1000, which simplifies to 7/8.</li>
                <li>0.2 = 2/10 = 1/5: The decimal 0.2 can be expressed as the fraction 2/10, which simplifies to 1/5.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </example>
    <p>
        Now, let's prove that a rational number is equivalent to a terminating decimal* if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.
    </p>
    <p>*Note: this is not quite correct, as we'll see later that decimals that have repeating 9s to the right are equivalent to terminating decimals. We will discuss this in more depth later. </p>
    <proof xml:id="proof-terminating-decimal">
        <title>Proof</title>
        <p>
            Since this is an "if and only if" statement in the form <m>P \leftrightarrow Q</m>, we have to prove two results, <m>P \rightarrow Q</m> and <m>Q \rightarrow P</m>.  Let's denote a rational number as a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0. We want to show that a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal. Then, by definition of a terminating decimal, a/b can be written as a decimal with a finite number of digits. This means that a/b can be expressed as a decimal fraction, because a decimal fraction is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10, and any terminating decimal can be expressed in this form.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, suppose a/b is equivalent to a decimal fraction. Then a/b can be expressed as a decimal with a finite number of digits, because a decimal fraction is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10, and any fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10 can be expressed as a terminating decimal. Therefore, a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting both results together, a rational number is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.
        </p>
    </proof>
    <p>Let's look at a non-example; 7/15. Since <m>15=3 \times 5</m> and 3 and 7 share no common factors, there is no way of "cancelling" the factor of 3 in the denominator. Thus there is nothing we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by so that both are still integers and the denominator does not have a factor of 3, and thus it isn't equivalent to a decimal fraction, which has denominators of the form <m>10^k=2^k5^k</m>.</p> 
</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="repeating-decimals-long-division">
    <title>Expressing a Fraction as a Repeating Decimal Using Long Division</title>
    <p>
        If a fraction is not equivalent to a decimal fraction, it can be expressed as a repeating decimal. One way to do this is by using long division. During this process, we may notice that we "run out" of non-zero remainders before the remainders must repeat, indicating a repeating decimal.
    </p>
    <p>Why is this the case? Well, imagine you are dividing <m>a</m> by some non-zero integer <m>b</m>. There are only finitely many possible remainders: <m>\{0,1,2, \ldots, b-2, b-1 \}</m>.  </p>
        <p>Now, we can convert a fraction a/b to its decimal representation by long division. If we do get a reminder of 0, then we know that the decimal is a terminating decimal. So imagine that a/b cannot be expressed as a terminating decimal. Then we will never see the remainder 0, and thus we only have <m>b-1</m> possible remainders when performing each partial division in the long division algorithm. Note that we can add as many zeros to the right (after the decimal and after all non-zero decimal digits); e.g. 20.201 = 20.2010000... Let's call these the <term>trailing zeroes.</term> </p>
    <p>Now when we get to using the place values of the trailing zeros, every time we "bring down" a digit from a new place value, that digit will be 0. If, at this point, we keep track of remainders, we note that we have at most <m>b-1</m> unique remainders before one must repeat. At the point of repetition, our "previous work" will repeat over and over again, since we will only end up in situations we have seen before and thus the digits of decimal representation of our fraction between the repeated remainders will repeat over and over again to the right. Thus, we know that if fraction is not equivalent to a terminating decimal, it must be a repeating decimal.</p>
    <example xml:id="example-long-division-2-7">
        <title>Example: Expressing 2/7 as a Repeating Decimal Using Long Division</title>
        <p>
            Let's express the fraction 2/7 as a repeating decimal using long division.
            <ol>
                <li>Divide 2 by 7. Since 2 is less than 7, we add a decimal point and a zero to the right of 2, making it 20.</li>
                <li>Now, divide 20 by 7. The result is 2 with a remainder of 6.</li>
                <li>Add another zero to the right of the remainder, making it 60.</li>
                <li>Divide 60 by 7. The result is 8 with a remainder of 4.</li>
                <li>Repeat this process. Each time, we add a zero to the right of the remainder and divide by 7.</li>
                <li>Eventually, we notice that the remainders start to repeat (and must repeat, since there are only a finite number of remainders), indicating a repeating decimal.</li>
            </ol>
            So, 2/7 = 0.<m>\overline{285714}</m>.

            <ol>

                <li>Now, divide 60 by 13. The result is 4 with a remainder of 8.</li>
                <li>Add another zero to the right of the remainder, making it 80.</li>
                <li>Divide 80 by 13. The result is 6 with a remainder of 2.</li>
                <li>Repeat this process. Each time, we add a zero to the right of the remainder and divide by 13.</li>

        <p>
            In decimal notation, 1/3 is equivalent to 0.333..., so the sum is 0.333... + 0.333... + 0.333... = 0.999.... ADD PIC OF THIS ADDITION

        <p>
            Let's convert the repeating decimal 0.<m>\overline{3}</m> to a fraction using the above algorithm:
            <ol>
                <li>Let x = 0.<m>\overline{3}</m>.</li>
                <li>The period of the repetend is 1, so p = 1.</li>
                <li>Calculate (10^p)x - x = 10x - x = 9x. In decimal form, this is 3.333... - 0.333... = 3.</li>

                <li>The period of the repetend is 2, so p = 2.</li>
                <li>Calculate (10^p)x - x = 100x - x = 99x. In decimal form, this is 27.2727... - 0.2727... = 27.</li>

      Understanding percent and percent change is crucial in various aspects of mathematics, finance, and everyday life. This section will explain what percent is, how to work with percents in different contexts, and how to distinguish between percent change and percentage point change. Whether you are calculating discounts during a sale, analyzing statistical data, or understanding financial growth, a firm grasp of these concepts is essential. By the end of this section, you will be equipped with the skills to handle a variety of problems involving percents and their changes.

      <title>Introduction to Percent</title>
      <p>
        A percent is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word "percent" comes from the Latin "per centum," which means "by the hundred." This means that percents are inherently tied to the concept of fractions and ratios. For instance, 50% is equivalent to <m>50/100</m> or <m>0.5</m>. In practical terms, this means that 50% represents half of a given quantity. Understanding percents as fractions helps in visualizing parts of a whole, making it easier to compare and analyze data. Similarly, percents can also be viewed as ratios, where 50% means 50 parts out of 100 parts. This ratio perspective is particularly useful in fields like statistics and probability, where relationships between quantities are often examined.
      </p>
  
      <subsubsection xml:id="converting-ratios-to-percents">
        <title>Converting Ratios to Percents</title>
        <p>
          To convert a ratio to a percent, multiply the ratio by 100. This conversion process involves scaling the ratio to a common base of 100, making it easier to understand and compare. For example, the ratio 3:4 can be converted to a percent as follows: <me>\frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75\%</me>. This means that 3 out of 4 parts is the same as 75 out of 100 parts, which is a more intuitive way to grasp the proportion. This method is particularly useful in various practical scenarios such as interpreting statistical data, comparing success rates, or even understanding sports statistics.
        </p>
  
        <example xml:id="example-ratios-to-percents">
          <title>Example: Ratios to Percents</title>
          <p>
            Convert the ratio 2:5 to a percent. This requires us to scale the given ratio to a base of 100 to find an equivalent percent value.
          </p>
          <solution>
            <me>
            \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\%
            </me>
            <p>
              Thus, the ratio 2:5 is equivalent to 40%, meaning 2 parts out of 5 is the same as 40 parts out of 100. This method of conversion is essential in comparing ratios in a standardized format that is widely understood.

          To convert a fraction to a percent, first convert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply by 100. This two-step process involves dividing the numerator by the denominator to get a decimal, then scaling the decimal to a percentage. For example, to convert <m>\frac{1}{8}</m> to a percent: <me>\frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \\ 0.125 \times 100 = 12.5\%</me>. This conversion is important because it translates the fraction into a percentage, which is a more familiar and easily interpretable format for most people. This method is widely used in various fields such as finance, education, and health, where data is often presented in percent form for better clarity and impact.

      <title>Visualizing Percents Using a Bar Diagram</title>
      <p>
        A bar diagram is a useful tool for visualizing percents. By representing the whole as a bar divided into 100 equal parts, we can easily see how a certain percentage compares to the whole. This visual representation makes it easier to grasp the concept of percents and their relative sizes. Bar diagrams are particularly effective in educational settings, where visual aids can enhance understanding. They also find use in data presentation, where complex numerical information can be made more accessible and engaging through visual means. By translating numerical data into visual forms, bar diagrams help bridge the gap between abstract concepts and tangible understanding.
      </p>
  
      <example xml:id="bar-diagram-example-1">
        <title>Example: Using a Bar Diagram</title>
        <p>
          If 30% of a class of 40 students are boys, how many boys are in the class? This problem involves using a bar diagram to visualize the percentage and determine the actual number of boys.
        </p>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Using a bar diagram, we represent the whole class of 40 students as a bar divided into 100 parts. Each part represents 0.4 students (since 40 students / 100 parts = 0.4 students per part). By identifying 30% of the bar, we can determine the number of boys.
          </p>
          
            <me>
            30\% \times 40 = 0.30 \times 40 = 12 \text{ boys}
            </me>
            <p>
              Therefore, there are 12 boys in the class. This example shows how bar diagrams can be used to break down and solve percentage problems, making the data more comprehensible and easier to work with.

          25% of a certain amount is 50. What is the whole amount? This problem uses a bar diagram to visualize the percentage and back-calculate to find the total amount.
        </p>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Using a bar diagram, we know that 25% corresponds to 50. We need to find the total amount (100%). By understanding that 25% is one-quarter of the total, we can determine the whole by scaling up from the given percentage.
          </p>
          
            <me>
            25\% = \frac{50}{\text{whole amount}} \\
            \text{whole amount} = \frac{50}{0.25} = 200
            </me>

      <title>Percent vs. Percent Change</title>
      <p>
        Percent represents a part of a whole, while percent change represents the degree of change over time. Percent change is calculated by taking the difference between the new value and the old value, dividing by the old value, and then multiplying by 100. Understanding the difference between percent and percent change is critical in contexts such as financial analysis, where it's important to distinguish between the portion of a whole and the rate of change over a period. Percent change provides insights into trends, growth rates, and the relative impact of changes in values, which is essential for making informed decisions.
      </p>
  
      <example xml:id="percent-change-example-1">
        <title>Example: Percent Change</title>
        <p>
          A stock price increases from $50 to $75. What is the percent change? This problem involves calculating the relative change in value to understand the growth of the stock price.
        </p>
        <solution>
          <me>
          \frac{75 - 50}{50} \times 100 = 50\%

      <title>Percent Change vs. Percentage Point Change</title>
      <p>
        Percent change and percentage point change are different concepts that are often confused. Percent change measures the relative change between two values as a percentage of the original value. It is useful for understanding the proportional increase or decrease. On the other hand, percentage point change measures the absolute change between two percentages. This is particularly important in fields such as economics and public policy, where the distinction between relative and absolute changes can have significant implications. Understanding the difference helps in accurately interpreting data and making informed decisions based on the nature of the change.

            Therefore, the percentage point change is 3 percentage points. This example highlights the importance of distinguishing between percent change and percentage point change, as the latter measures the direct difference between percentages, providing a straightforward understanding of shifts in rates.
