<p id="p-1920">As a reminder, when we add two rational numbers, the result is also a rational number. This is known as the closure property of addition for rational numbers. Formally, if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are rational numbers, then <span class="process-math">\(a + b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a - b\)</span> are also rational numbers.</p>
<p id="p-1921">However, we can show that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is always irrational. Let's state this formally as a theorem and prove it by contradiction.</p>

<p id="p-1922">Let <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> be a rational number and <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> be an irrational number. Then <span class="process-math">\(r + i\)</span> is irrational.</p></article><article class="hiddenproof" id="proof-31"><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref proof-knowl original" data-refid="hk-proof-31"><h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h4></a></article><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-proof-31"><article class="hiddenproof"><p id="p-1923">Assume for the sake of contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(r + i\)</span> is a rational number. Since the set of rational numbers is closed under addition and subtraction, we can write:</p>
<p id="p-1924"><span class="process-math">\(r + i = q\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is a rational number.</p>
<p id="p-1925">We can then subtract <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> from both sides of the equation:</p>
<p id="p-1926"><span class="process-math">\(i = q - r\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1927">Since both <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> are rational numbers, and the difference of two rational numbers is also rational, <span class="process-math">\(q - r\)</span> must be rational.</p>
<p id="p-1928">This implies that <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is rational, which contradicts our initial assumption that <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is irrational. Therefore, our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(r + i\)</span> is rational must be false, and <span class="process-math">\(r + i\)</span> is indeed irrational.</p></article></div>
<p id="p-1929">It is important to note that while the sum of a finite number of rational numbers is rational, the sum of infinitely many rational numbers can be irrational. This can be understood by considering the decimal expansion of certain numbers.</p>
<p id="p-1930">For example, the number <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> (pi) is known to be irrational. Its decimal expansion is non-repeating and non-terminating:</p>
<p id="p-1931"><span class="process-math">\(\pi = 3.141592653589793238...\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1932">If we express <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> as the sum of its decimal parts, we get an infinite series of rational numbers:</p>
<p id="p-1933"><span class="process-math">\(\pi = 3 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.001 +0.0005 + 0.00009 + 0.000002 + \ldots\)</span></p>
<p id="p-1934">Each term in this series is a rational number, but their infinite sum converges to the irrational number <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span> This demonstrates that the sum of infinitely many rational numbers can indeed be irrational.</p>
<p id="p-1935">When adding two irrational numbers, the result can be either rational or irrational. Let's explore this with two examples:</p>

<p id="p-1941">This sum is still an irrational number because there is no way to express it as a ratio of two integers; we will justify this claim in the following section.</p></article></div>
