<p>Let's look at what changes from <span class="process-math">\(9 \times 10\)</span> to the next line <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 20\text{.}\)</span> If we didn't round down we would have <span class="process-math">\(4.5 \times 20.\)</span> When we round down we are deleting area from our rectangle. We have <span class="process-math">\(0.5 \times 20\text{,}\)</span> or equivalently <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 10\)</span> less area than in the line above. And indeed, the amount of area we are deleting is the right-hand number of the line above. So we need to account for this missing area by adding it back in at the end.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC DESCRIBING MISSING AREA</p>
<p>After this line, the calculation is the same as <span class="process-math">\(8 \times 10\text{.}\)</span> So we have the product being the right hand number of the final line <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 80\)</span> plus the "missing" area, which is accounted for in the right hand number of the line <span class="process-math">\(9 \times 10\text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(9 \times 10 = 80+10 = 90.\)</span></p>
