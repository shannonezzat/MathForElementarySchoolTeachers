<p>A few notes:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The method of elimination is more useful when you have larger systems of equations with more equations and/or more variables. In the <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> case, substitution is generally easy enough to do. However, it is good practice to be able to us the elimination method, as it is extremely more efficient and useful than substitution in these larger systems.</p></li>
<li><p>You can eliminate any variable using any equation in your system that you want. It's usually a good idea to choose a variable with small/easy-to-work-with coefficients, but if you choose another variable, you will still get the correct result.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you choose a variable to eliminate, a common and useful technique is to multiply each equation by the cofficent of the variable in the other equation, and then add or subtract to eliminate that vaariable.</p></li>
