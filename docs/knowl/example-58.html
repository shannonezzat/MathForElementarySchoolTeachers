<p>Let's subtract <span class="process-math">\(4052-2457\)</span> using the equal addition algorithm. As usual we line up our numbers so digits of the same place value are in the same column, but this time we will have just a little bit of space between the bottom number and our difference (for any borrowed 1's that will appear). And, as usual, we will include blocks for added pictoral understanding.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Starting with the ones place, we see that the digit <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in the top number is less than the digit <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> in the bottom. So we "borrow" 10 ones, but unlike the standard subtraction algorithm we are "in debt" 1 ten to the bottom number. Thus, we have <span class="process-math">\((10+2)-7=12-7=5\)</span> ones in our difference. We mark this, and our additional debt of 1 ten, in our calculation:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Now we move to the tens place. We see that the <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> in the top number is less than the <span class="process-math">\(5+1\)</span> in the bottom number, so we "borrow" 10 tens from 1 hundred in the same way as the previous step to have <span class="process-math">\((10+5)-(5+1)=15-6=9\)</span> tens in our difference.  We mark this, and our additional debt of 1 hundred, in our calculation:</p>
<p>INCLUDE PIC HERE</p>
<p>Now we move to the hundreds place. We see that the <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> in the top number is less than the <span class="process-math">\(4+1\)</span> in the bottom number, so we "borrow" 10 hundreds from 1 thousand in the same way as our previous two steps to have <span class="process-math">\((10+0)-(4+1)=10-5=5\)</span> hundreds in our difference. We mark this, and our additional debt of 1 thousand, in our calculation:</p>
<p>INCLUDE PIC HERE</p>
<p>Finally we move to the thousands place. We see that <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> in the top number is greater than the <span class="process-math">\(2+1\)</span> in the bottom number, so we subtract without borrowing: <span class="process-math">\(4-(2+1)=4-3=1\)</span> and write this in our answer. As there are no more non-zero digits to the left (that is; no larger places than thousands in our numbers,) we are finished, and we have calculated <span class="process-math">\(4052-2457=1595.\)</span></p>
