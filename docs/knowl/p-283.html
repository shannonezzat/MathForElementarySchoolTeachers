<p>Looking at the first example, we want both Venn diagrams to be true. The only way for this to be possible is if both circles are actually the same circle! That's because the two ideas of polygons with three sides and triangles are really the same thing. These situations are very special, and we can think of one part as just a "rewording" of the idea of the other part. Formally, we call statements where both the original statement and its converse are true <dfn class="terminology">biconditional statements</dfn> and we write it as "P if and only if Q", which means "(if P then Q) *and* (if Q then P)".</p>
