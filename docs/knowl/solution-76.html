<p>First, we need to find out how much of the job each person can do in one hour, which is referred to as their work rate. Note that our "unit" in this case is the job, and we need to calculate the proportion of the job each person can complete in one hour, thus giving us our work rate.</p>
<p>The work rate of Person A is 1/4 of the job per hour, for Person B it's 1/5 of the job per hour, and for Person C it's 1/10 of the job per hour.</p>
<p>When they work together, their work rates add up. So, the total work rate is (1/4 + 1/5 + 1/10) of the job per hour.</p>
<p>To find out how long it takes them to complete the job working together, we take the reciprocal of the total work rate. This will give us the total time it takes all three to complete the job working together.</p>
<p>First, calculate the total work rate: 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/10 = 1/2 per hour. This means that working together, they complete half the job in one hour.</p> <p>Then, we can find <span class="process-math">\(t,\)</span> the amount of time (in hours) needed by solving the following equation: <span class="process-math">\(1/2 t = 1\text{,}\)</span> where the <span class="process-math">\(1/2\)</span> is the rate of jobs/hour and 1 is the number of jobs (remember, our unit is a job, so that's what 1 stands for in this case.) .</p> <p>It's then easy to solve this and get <span class="process-math">\(t=2\)</span> hours.</p>
<p>So, working together, it takes Person A, Person B, and Person C 2 hours to finish the job.</p>
