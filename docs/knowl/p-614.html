<p>In this section, we will talk about the four main operations of arithmetic of whole numbers; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The idea is that we will start with the idea of addition, and "build" the others from that. Indeed, mathematicians like to start with as little as possible, and making as many results and ideas out of this starting place as we can.</p>
