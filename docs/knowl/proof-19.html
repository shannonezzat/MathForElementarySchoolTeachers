<p>Since this is a biconditional statement, we need to show that <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q \to P\text{.}\)</span> The direction <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> was already proved in the first paragraph of this subsection. So let's do the other direction.</p>
<p>Let's assume the "if-part" is true: let <span class="process-math">\(a \mid n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b \mid n\text{.}\)</span> We need to show that the "then-part" is true, that is, <span class="process-math">\(ab \mid n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since we know <span class="process-math">\(a \mid n\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(n=ar\)</span> for some natural number <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> But we also know <span class="process-math">\(b \mid n\text{,}\)</span> so since <span class="process-math">\(n=ar\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(b \mid ar\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(ar\)</span> has a factor of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> share no common factors, then all of the factors of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> must be in <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(r=bs\)</span> for some number <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(n=ar = a(bs) = (ab)s\text{.}\)</span> So since we've written <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> as a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(ab\text{,}\)</span> this means that <span class="process-math">\(ab \mid n\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="divisibility-theorems-small-numbers.html#proof-19">in-context</a></span>
