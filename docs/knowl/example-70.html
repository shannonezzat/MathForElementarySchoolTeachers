<p>Let's do the calculation <span class="process-math">\(587 \div 4\text{.}\)</span> We write this using the long division symbol. We think of <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> as the number of groups we are making (using the partitive model of division).</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS, ALONG WITH BLOCKS TOO</p>
<p>Starting with the hundreds place, we find that we can group at most one hundred evenly into each of our four groups. We note this in the quotient by putting a <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> in the hundreds place. We have <span class="process-math">\(5-4=1\)</span> hundred remaining.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS, ALONG WITH GROUPING</p>
<p>Now we "ungroup" our one hundred into 10 tens, giving us <span class="process-math">\(10+8=18\)</span> tens. We note this in our calculation by "bringing down" the <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> tens in the dividend.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now, we can evenly divide our <span class="process-math">\(18\)</span> tens so that <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> are in each group, with <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> tens remaining (since <span class="process-math">\(18=4 \times 4 +2\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(18 \div 4 = 4R2\text{.}\)</span>) We write the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> in the tens place of the quotient, and we have <span class="process-math">\(18-4 \times 4=18-16=2\)</span> tens remaining. We write this down in our calculation.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>We "ungroup" the <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> tens into <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> longs giving us <span class="process-math">\(20+7 = 27 \)</span> longs. We write this in our calculation.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Finally, we can divide our <span class="process-math">\(27\)</span> ones so that <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> are in each group of <span class="process-math">\(4\text{.}\)</span> We write this in our quotient and since <span class="process-math">\(27 \div 4 = 6R3\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> ones remaining. Since we are at the ones place we are finished our calculation, and thus <span class="process-math">\(587 \div 4 = 146R3\text{.}\)</span> Each group of <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(146\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> ones unable to be grouped evenly.</p>
