<p>Percent change and percentage point change are different concepts that are often confused. Percent change measures the relative change between two values as a percentage of the original value. It is useful for understanding the proportional increase or decrease. On the other hand, percentage point change measures the absolute change between two percentages. This is particularly important in fields such as economics and public policy, where the distinction between relative and absolute changes can have significant implications. Understanding the difference helps in accurately interpreting data and making informed decisions based on the nature of the change.</p>
