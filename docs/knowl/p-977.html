<p>Just like addition and subtraction, there is nothing special about base ten that allows these multiplication algorithms to work. In base <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> multiplication by powers of <span class="process-math">\(10_b\)</span> behaves the same way as in base ten. Also, we have the same notion of expanded form in any base we choose. The only thing that is different is our knowledge of multiplication of single digits. Just as in base ten, we could make a "times table" for each base. However, in the interest of time and space, we will only work in one base; base twelve. Multiplying in other bases would work the same, except for the multiplication table for single digit numbers, of course.</p>
