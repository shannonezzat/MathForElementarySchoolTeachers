<li><p>Let's start to think about numbers divisible by both, noting that <span class="process-math">\(6=2 \times 3\text{.}\)</span> Using a calculator if you wish, write down around 10 or 20 examples of numbers with both 2 and 3 as factors (can you think about how to easily make these?). Are these numbers also divisible by 6? Check!</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven't found one above, can you think of a number that is divisible by 2 and 3 but not divisible by 6?</p></li>

<li><p>Let's try another number, say <span class="process-math">\(24=6 \times 4\text{.}\)</span> Write down many numbers with both 6 and 4 as factors. Is 24 also a factor of these numbers? Check!</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven't found one above, can you think of a number that is divisible by 6 and 4 but not divisible by 24?</p></li>
<li><p>Try the above with other sets of numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> for example try <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 5=15\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 4=8\text{.}\)</span> Do you notice a pattern about  the numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a \times b\)</span> is always a factor of numbers where both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are factors, and when there are numbers that do not have <span class="process-math">\(a \times b\)</span> as a factor?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the above example you probably have seen that if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> have no common factors, then <span class="process-math">\(a \times b\)</span> is necessarily a factor of any number where both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are factors. Let's try and prove this.</p>

<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(a,b\)</span> be numbers with no common factors (that is, <span class="process-math">\(\text{GCD}(a,b)=1\)</span>), and let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be another number. Then <span class="process-math">\(ab \mid n \)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(a \mid n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b \mid n\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="hiddenproof"><a href="" class="proof-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/proof-19-hidden.html" title="Proof 6.2.26.1"><h6 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h6></a></article></p>
<p>To show that combining divisibility rules for numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> doesn't work if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> have a common factor, let's try and develop a counterexample for each choice of two numbers with a common factor.</p>
