<p>The divisibility rule for 5 is also incredibly well known. Most people reading this should know that you only need to check whether the last digit of the number is either 5 or 0. However, like the divisibility rule for 2, it will be more advantageous to think the rule as the last digit being divisible by <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> Note that the rule for divisibility by 2 relies on the fact that <span class="process-math">\(10=2\times5\text{,}\)</span> since all multiples of <span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> including powers of <span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> are also divisbile by <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(10=2 \times 5,\)</span> the exact same idea should work for <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> as well as <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> In fact, we should be able to write down the exact same argument for divisibility by 5 as divisibility by 2, with all the 2's replaced by 5:</p>
