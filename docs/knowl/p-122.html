<p>Now, we want a circle to represent all objects that satisfy B (in out example, things that are grey). Note that there could be cats that are not grey, and grey things that are not cats, so we need to draw the diagram so that they only partially overlap. We also know that there is definitely at least one A that is B (cat that is grey) since the statement tells us so, therefore we can put a little dot in the intersection to represent that object (the grey cat).</p>
