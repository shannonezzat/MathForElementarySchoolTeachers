<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Let's find the sum <span class="process-math">\(6A3_{twelve}+90B_{twelve}\text{.}\)</span> First of all, it will be helpful to view these as blocks:</p>
<p>INSERT BLOCK PIC OF NUMBERS</p>
<p>Let's start with the ones place. We have <span class="process-math">\(3_{twelve}+B_{twelve} = 12_{twelve} \)</span> ones (think three + eleven ones is fourteen ones), where we regrouped twelve ones to make 1 long (containing twelve ones) with 2 ones remaining. We "carry" our one long, and write down our 2 ones:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS WITH ALGORITHM TO THE SIDE</p>
<p>Now we add our longs place. We have <span class="process-math">\(A_{twelve}+0_{twelve}+1_{twelve} = B_{twelve}\)</span> longs. Since eleven longs is not enough to regroup in base twelve, we simply write this down.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS WITH ALGORITHM TO THE SIDE</p>
<p>Now we add our squares place. We have <span class="process-math">\(6_{twelve}+9_{twelve} = 13_{twelve}\)</span> squares, where twelve squares are regrouped to make one of the next place value (cubes) and we have 3 squares remaining. (Do this calculation on the side to make sure that you understand it). Since we are "out" of places in our numbers we simply write this down in our algorithm:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS WITH ALGORITHM TO THE SIDE</p>
<p>We have just calculated that <span class="process-math">\(6A3_{twelve}+90B_{twelve} = 13B2_{twelve}\)</span> and we are finished.</p></article></body>
