<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Similar to the previous proof, let's show this by contradiction. We'll pretend we have a counterexample (in fact the smallest counterexample), and show that something "breaks", so thus there must be no counterexamples. The contradiction we'll have is that even though we picked the smallest counterexample, we'll find one that's smaller.</p>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be the smallest composite number (if-part true) that has no prime factors (then-part false). Since <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is composite and has no prime factors, then <span class="process-math">\(n=ab\)</span> for some composite numbers <span class="process-math">\(a,b\text{.}\)</span> But all proper factors of a number are between <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> exclusive (that is <span class="process-math">\(1 &lt; a,b &lt; n\)</span>). But since <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has no prime factors, neither can <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> since if <span class="process-math">\(a=pc\)</span> for some prime number <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(n=ab=(pc)b=p(cb)\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> But this means that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a smaller composite number than <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with no prime factors, so <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> isn't the smallest counterexample, even though we picked it to be. This means that there is no smallest counterexample, and thus no counterexample to our statement. So <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> must have at least one prime factor.</p></article></body>
