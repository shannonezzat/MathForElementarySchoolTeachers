<p>Does it have to be the case that multiplication by zero always gives and answer of zero, or is that something we just decided because it works (more specifically, do we need to make an axoim covering multiplication by zero)? In fact, it's somthing that *must* follow from previous properties we've discussed. An important result that can be proved from axioms or previous results is called a <dfn class="terminology">theorem</dfn>. Let's write this as a theorem, and then prove it. We have to be careful here, since we may be tempted to simplify <span class="process-math">\(a \times 0 = 0\text{,}\)</span> but we need to put ourselves in the mindset of the first person ever to think about this; we have no idea what it could equal, so we need to solve for it using some properties that we know.</p>
