<p>Since Angela is thirty year's younger than her father, we need to think about how to translate this to an algebraic statement. We can think of trying to reword this sentence to have the concept of equality in it. For example, we could say "Angela's age plus thirty years is the same age as her father" or "If you subtract thirty years from her father's age, it will be Angela's age" or something else. Using the first rewording, we can make the algebraic equation</p>
