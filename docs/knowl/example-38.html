<p>Let's subtract <span class="process-math">\(4052-2457\)</span> using the same change algorithm. We line up the two numbers as usual (and we'll keep block representations along with our calculation to see the process in a pictoral way)</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Starting at the ones place, we notice that the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, we add 3 to both the top and bottom numbers (<span class="process-math">\((4052+3)-(2457+3))\)</span>) to obtain the new subtraction problem <span class="process-math">\(4055-2460\text{.}\)</span> Notice that the bottom digit is now 0, so this will eventually make subtraction easy (at the cost of doing a bit of addition)</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE INCLUDING NEW SUBTRACTION PROBLEM</p>
<p>Now we move left to the tens place. As before, we notice that the top digit is less than the bottom digit, so add the opposite digit number of tens to both numbers. Since the opposite of <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> we add <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> to both numbers (<span class="process-math">\((4055+40)-(2460+40)\)</span>) to make the new subtraction problem <span class="process-math">\(4095-2500.\)</span></p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Moving to the hundreds place, since the top digit is less than the bottom digit, we add the opposite number of hundreds, that is <span class="process-math">\(500\text{,}\)</span> to both numbers to obtain the new subtraction problem <span class="process-math">\(4595-3000\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Moving left to the thousands place, we notice that the top digit is greater than or equal to (in this case, greater than) the bottom digit, so we do nothing. Also, there are no non-zero digits in any places to our left (thousands is the largest place in our numbers) so we can now easily subtract place by place to obtain our final answer <span class="process-math">\(4595-3000=1595.\)</span></p>
