<section class="introduction" id="introduction-11"><p id="p-852">The way we multiply by hand is intrinsically based on both the ideas of place value, and the property of distributivity. In all of the following algorithms, both ideas will be important. Before we begin talking about how to multiply, we need to know how to do two things well; multiply powers of ten together, and how to multiply two single digits together. The first of these is very easy. The second is easy too, but there are a lot of different cases.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec-MultiplicationPreliminaries"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<p id="p-853">Thinking about place values as powers of ten, we can use our expoent rules to help us here. First of all, we can think of powers of ten, say <span class="process-math">\(10^n\text{,}\)</span> as "a 1 followed by <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> zeroes". So, for example, <span class="process-math">\(10^5 = 100,000.\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-854">Using our exponent rules we know <span class="process-math">\(10^n \times 10^m = 10^{n+m}\text{.}\)</span> For example, <span class="process-math">\(10^3 \times 10^5 = 10^8\text{.}\)</span> Or, written as numbers, <span class="process-math">\(1000 \times 100,000 = 100,000,000\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-855">Moving on to multiplying single digits together, we *could* calculate these using, for example, the repeated addition model of multiplication every time, but single digit multiplication comes up so often its much better to know these off the top of our heads. It is indeed worth memorizing all single digit multiplications if you haven't yet.</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-865">All of our algorithms for multiplication rely heavily on place value and distributivity. For the <dfn class="terminology">partial products algorithm</dfn> we calculate a product of two whole numbers by doing the following:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-217"><p id="p-866">Write (or at least view in your head) both numbers in expanded form. Usually, this is done by writing the numbers so that the same place values are in the same column.</p></li>
<li id="li-218"><p id="p-867">Multiply each single digit multiple of powers of ten in the first number by each single digit multiple of powers of ten in the second number. For each calculation, write down this partial product, lining it up according to place value with the other partial products.</p></li>
<li id="li-219"><p id="p-868">Sum all partial products together (using, for example, the standard addition algorithm) to find the final product of the two numbers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-869">Let's do an example. Along with this example, we will include both an algebraic and pictoral representation , using the area model of multiplication, of the process.</p>
<article class="example example-like" id="example-64"><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref example-knowl original" data-refid="hk-example-64"><h4 class="heading">

<p id="p-871">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-872">Now, using distributivity, we calculate each partial product: since there are 3 terms in the first expanded form and 3 in the second, we will have <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 2 = 6\)</span> partial products to calculate. We can start anywhere we like, but usually one starts by multiplying the bottom ones place by every place in the top number. Then, working right to left, we multiply the tens place by every place in the top number.</p>
<p id="p-873">INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-874">Algebraically, we can view this in the following way. Note that the order the terms will be first the "natual" order that one would do using distributivity, and then reordered (in fact reversed, as it's usual to perform the algorithm from right to left and bottom to top) to match the partial products algorithm:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(300+ 40 + 8) \times (90+ 7) 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 300 \times 90 + 300 \times 7 + 40 \times 90 + 40 \times 7 + 8 \times 90 + 8 \times 7
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 7 \times 8 + 7 \times 40 + 7 \times 300 + 90 \times 8 + 90 \times 40 + 90 \times 300
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 56 + 280 + 2100 + 720 + 3600 + 27,000
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p id="p-875">Pictorally, we can view this as "sub-areas" of each rectangle:</p>
<p id="p-876">INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-877">Finally, we sum the partial products together to get our final product. We'll do this using the standard addition algorithm. Pictorally, we are adding all sub-areas together, and algebraically we are simply adding:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 56 + 280 + 2100 + 720 + 3600 + 27,000 = 33756

<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">5.3.3</span> <span class="title">Standard Multiplication Algorithm</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-880">The <dfn class="terminology">standard multiplication algorithm</dfn> is, very likely, the method that you would have been taught how to multiply numbers in elementary school. It is very related to the partial products algorithm. The main difference is that we only expand one of our numbers, our "bottom number", into expanded form. For example, we would think of the multiplication <span class="process-math">\(348 \times 97\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(348 \times (90 + 8)\text{.}\)</span> We can view this in our area model as only subdividing our rectangle in one direction:</p>
<p id="p-881">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-882">Note that since multiplication is commutative, we know that <span class="process-math">\(348 \times 97 = 97 \times 348\text{.}\)</span> However, the calculation will be different since we would be subdividing our rectangle in "the other direction" when we think of <span class="process-math">\(97 \times (300+40+8)\text{.}\)</span> Indeed, we could use this as a "check" to make sure that we did the calculation correctly; both products should, of course, be the same</p>
<p id="p-883">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-884">Of course, multiplying a non-single-digit number (like <span class="process-math">\(348\)</span>) by a single digit number isn't as easy as multiplying two single digit numbers together. We will still multiply place by place, but instead of writing down each individual place multiplication calculation, we will do them all at once, and keep track of any regroupings by "carries" above the digits in our top number.</p>
<p id="p-885">The algorithm for the standard algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-220"><p id="p-886">Write (or at least view in your head) one of the numbers in expanded form. Usually, this is done by writing the numbers so that the same place values are in the same column so that the expanded number is the bottom number. Start with the right-most digit in the bottom number.</p></li>
<li id="li-221"><p id="p-887">Starting from the right, write the number of zeroes associated to the place value of the current digit in the bottom number that you're working with in the row below the previous one you've calculated, if any exist.</p></li>
<li id="li-222"><p id="p-888">Working from right to left, multiply the bottom digit by each digit in the top number, adding any regroupings from the previous multiplication if they exist. If the product is greater than 9, regroup the tens to the next place value by writing the number of tens over the digit to the left in the top number. Write down the ones digit of your calculation to the left of the previous digit you have written, if any exist.</p></li>
<li id="li-223"><p id="p-889">Once there are no more non-zero digits to the left in the top number, if there are non-zero digits to the left of your current digit in the bottom number, move one digit to the left in the bottom number and return to Step 2. If there are no non-zero numbers to the left, move on to the next step.</p></li>
<li id="li-224"><p id="p-890">Sum all partial products together (using, for example, the standard addition algorithm) to find the final product of the two numbers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-891">As usual, we compute the same example so we can see the commonalities and diffrences between algorithms. Also, we will have a pictoral representation alongside our calculation.</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-907">Look closely at the algorithms for multiplication. Is there anything about the steps in the algorithm that are applicable to only base ten? You should see that this isn't the case. Since the ideas of an expanded form and distributivity occur in any base, we can use these algorithms to multiply in any base we like.</p>
<p id="p-908">Just like addition and subtraction, there is nothing special about base ten that allows these multiplication algorithms to work. In base <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> multiplication by powers of <span class="process-math">\(10_b\)</span> behaves the same way as in base ten. Also, we have the same notion of expanded form in any base we choose. The only thing that is different is our knowledge of multiplication of single digits. Just as in base ten, we could make a "times table" for each base. However, in the interest of time and space, we will only work in one base; base twelve. Multiplying in other bases would work the same, except for the multiplication table for single digit numbers, of course.</p>
<p id="p-909">A quick reminder that in base twelve, we ony regroup when we have twleve of one place. We represent ten of a place by the symbol <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and eleven of a place by the symbol <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Also, note that in this section we will assume all calculations are in base twelve, even if we do not note the base for each number; that is, for example, we'll write <span class="process-math">\(3A \times 15\)</span> to mean <span class="process-math">\(3A_{twelve} \times 15_{twelve}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-910">First, it makes sense to develop a multiplication table for base twelve. The most straightforward way is using repeated addition for multiplication. Let's do one row/column, the 5's, to illustrate the process. Here is a blank times table for every digit in base twelve; you can copy and fill in yourself:</p>
<p id="p-911">INSERT BLANK TIMES TABLE</p>
<p id="p-912">By the property of multiplicative identity, we know that <span class="process-math">\(1 \times 5 = 5\)</span> and we know that <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 5 = 5 + 5 = A\text{,}\)</span> since we have ten ones (not enough to regoup). We can determine <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 5\)</span> by adding <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 5\text{.}\)</span> Thus we have <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 5 = 2 \times 5 +5 = A+5 = 13\text{.}\)</span> We can input these into our times table in both the 5 row and 5 column since multiplication is commutative: <span class="process-math">\(5 \times n = n \times 5\)</span> for any number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-913">INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-914">We can continue in the same way, using our skills for addition in base twelve, to finish the rest of the "<span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> times table":</p>
<p id="p-915">INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-916">We can use the same idea for every other digit in base twelve to complete our entire multiplication table in base twelve for single digits. We'll leave this as an exerise:</p>

<p id="p-931">The two algorithms we have learned so far are quite similar to each other. However, there are other algorithms that look quite a bit different to the ones that we have used. Let's talk about one of these, sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">Russian multiplication</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">Ethiopian multiplication</dfn>. It relies on the fact that multiplication by two and division by two are inverse operations; more exactly, <span class="process-math">\((a \div 2) \times (b \times 2) = a \times b\text{.}\)</span> First we will describe the algorithm, then do an example, and then talk about why this algorithm works.</p>
<p id="p-932">The algorithm for Russian multiplication is as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-225"><p id="p-933">Write down both numbers side by side, with plenty of space below. Usually, the smaller of the two numbers is written on the left, but it doesn't have to be. Note that this counts as a "row" in the algorithm below.</p></li>
<li id="li-226"><p id="p-934">Take the left number and divide it by two. If the result is not a whole number, round down to the nearest whole number. Write this number below the left number.</p></li>
<li id="li-227"><p id="p-935">Take the right number and multiply it by two. Write this number below the right number.</p></li>
<li id="li-228"><p id="p-936">If the number on the left is 1, go to the next step. Else, go to Step 2.</p></li>
<li id="li-229"><p id="p-937">Cross out all rows where the left number is even.</p></li>
<li id="li-230"><p id="p-938">Sum the right number of all remaining rows. This sum is the product of the two numbers that you started with.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-939">If you haven't seen this algorithm before, it may look a lot different than what you're used to. Let's do an example to make sure we understand it. We'll use the same compuatation as the other algorithms.</p>

<p id="p-945">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-946">Now, we cross out all rows that contain an even number on the left.

<li id="li-242"><p id="p-978">The algorithm takes up a lot of space on the page, especially for numbers with many digits.</p></li>
<li id="li-243"><p id="p-979">There is no part of the page set aside to sum the partial products together, so it takes up even *more* room.</p></li>
<li id="li-244"><p id="p-980">Usually, the sub rectangles aren't sized to scale, and thus it might confuse students about the size of place values.</p></li>

</h4>
<p id="p-981">Pros:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-245"><p id="p-982">Doesn't take up a lot of space. In fact, if the bottom number has <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> digits, it only requires <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> rows for the partial sums (and an additional <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> rows above for the "carries".)</p></li>
<li id="li-246"><p id="p-983">There is less adding than in the partial products and grid method algorithms.</p></li>
<li id="li-247"><p id="p-984">It's the method that is most commonly known in North America, so it is easier to get help with this algorithm.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-985">Cons:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-248"><p id="p-986">Each row of the algorithm is a fairly complex multiplication, invloving carrying over to the next place value.</p></li>
<li id="li-249"><p id="p-987">The idea of place value isn't as obvious in the top number, thus losing somet of the idea of distributivity in the calculation.</p></li>
<li id="li-250"><p id="p-988">The algorithm isn't easily adaptable to multiplying other objects (like polynomials)</p></li>

<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">5.3.6.1</span> <span class="title">Russian Multiplication Algorithm</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-989">Pros:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-251"><p id="p-990">Relies on only being able to multiply and divide by one number (that is, of course, 2)</p></li>
<li id="li-252"><p id="p-991">The number of rows is quite small (indeed it's the number of digits in the base two representation of the left number.)</p></li>
<li id="li-253"><p id="p-992">The number of additions is even smaller, as we sum only some of the rows.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-993">Cons:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-254"><p id="p-994">It's not a well known algorithm, so it will be hard for a student to get help with it</p></li>
<li id="li-255"><p id="p-995">The idea of place value and distributivity is quite buried in the algorithm.</p></li>
<li id="li-256"><p id="p-996">It cannot be used to multiply other objects (like polynomials)</p></li>
<li id="li-257"><p id="p-997">The number of rows to add together changes based on the base two representation, which isn't obvious at forst glance. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(129\)</span> is the left number, you would need to add two numbers. However, if <span class="process-math">\(127\)</span> is the left number, you would need to add seven numbers.</p></li>
