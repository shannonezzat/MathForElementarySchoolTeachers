<p>The easiest way to view why distributivity holds is via a picture using the array model of multiplication. Consider a chocolate bar with <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> horizontal blocks and <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> vertical blocks. In total, the chocolate bar has <span class="process-math">\(6 \times 8 = 48\)</span> blocks:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Now, let's "break" this chocolate bar between the 3rd and 4th vertical block thus giving us 3 blocks in the first section and 5 in the second (of course, we still have the same amount of chocolate). So we can view this now as <span class="process-math">\(6 \times (3+5)=48\text{.}\)</span> But we could calculate the number of blocks separately in each of the two sections, and then add them together. Obviously we would still have the same amount of chocolate. So there are <span class="process-math">\(6 \times 3+ 6 \times 5 = 18 + 30 = 48\)</span> blocks of chocolate.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>This idea represents the idea behind distributivity. Note that distrivutivity is *very* important when we start discussing methods for multiplying in a later section.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-PropertiesOfArithmeticOperations.html#example-30">in-context</a></span>
