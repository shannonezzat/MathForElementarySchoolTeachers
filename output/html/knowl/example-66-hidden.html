<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Let's multiply <span class="process-math">\(348 \times 97\text{.}\)</span> First, we write the numbers lined up by place value, but we are thinking of these numbers in expanded form: <span class="process-math">\((300 + 40 + 8) \times (90 + 7). \)</span> Pictorally, we can view this as breaking up a rectangle with side lengths <span class="process-math">\(348\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(97\)</span> units into sub rectangles where the side lengths are the terms in each expanded form.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now, using distributivity, we calculate each partial product: since there are 3 terms in the first expanded form and 3 in the second, we will have <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 2 = 6\)</span> partial products to calculate. We can start anywhere we like, but usually one starts by multiplying the bottom ones place by every place in the top number. Then, working right to left, we multiply the tens place by every place in the top number.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Algebraically, we can view this in the following way. Note that the order the terms will be first the "natual" order that one would do using distributivity, and then reordered (in fact reversed, as it's usual to perform the algorithm from right to left and bottom to top) to match the partial products algorithm:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(300+ 40 + 8) \times (90+ 7) 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 300 \times 90 + 300 \times 7 + 40 \times 90 + 40 \times 7 + 8 \times 90 + 8 \times 7
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 7 \times 8 + 7 \times 40 + 7 \times 300 + 90 \times 8 + 90 \times 40 + 90 \times 300
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 56 + 280 + 2100 + 720 + 3600 + 27,000
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Pictorally, we can view this as "sub-areas" of each rectangle:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Finally, we sum the partial products together to get our final product. We'll do this using the standard addition algorithm. Pictorally, we are adding all sub-areas together, and algebraically we are simply adding:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
= 56 + 280 + 2100 + 720 + 3600 + 27,000 = 33756
\end{equation*}
</div>
