<p>We'll look at models of multiplication and exponents later in this chapter, but we will rely on our intuition about multiplication and our knowledge of exponents to help us talk about place value. We know that in our base ten number system, we group ten of one place to make one of the next place. We start with the ones place, which we can express as <span class="process-math">\(10^0\text{,}\)</span> as any non-zero number to the power of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (we will see why later.) So we know that we can express the tens place as 10 ones<span class="process-math">\(=10 \times 1 = 10^1\)</span> (remembering that an exponent of 1 is the same as having no exponent). We can also think of a "long" as being a one-dimensional object; that dimension being length.</p>
