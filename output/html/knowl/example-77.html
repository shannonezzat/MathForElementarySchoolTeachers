<p>Let's do <span class="process-math">\(986 \div 23\text{.}\)</span> Now, we don't know our <span class="process-math">\(23\)</span> times tables, so we are going to have to estimate. Let's write our calculation in the correct long divison form, and note that we won't include the block representation here, but it is worth using this representation if we need some visual guidance:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now, we know that we cannot group <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> hundreds evenly among <span class="process-math">\(23\)</span> groups, so we ungroup these into tens, giving us <span class="process-math">\(94\)</span> tens in total. We know that <span class="process-math">\(23\)</span> is close to <span class="process-math">\(20\text{,}\)</span> so we can use multiples of <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> as an estimation for the correct hundreds quotient. We know <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 20 = 80\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 20 = 100\text{,}\)</span> so let's see if we can put at most <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> tens evenly in each of our <span class="process-math">\(23\)</span> groups: <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 23 = 92\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 23 = 115\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> is the correct partial quotient. Subtracting, we find that we have a remainder of <span class="process-math">\(6\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Ungrouping these <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> tens into ones gives us <span class="process-math">\(66\)</span> ones in total. Using a similar procedure to before, we find that <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 23 = 46\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 23 = 69\)</span> so our ones quotient is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> with a remainder of <span class="process-math">\(66-46=20\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Thus we have calculated that <span class="process-math">\(986 \div 23 = 42R20\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-DivisionAlgorithms.html#example-77">in-context</a></span>
