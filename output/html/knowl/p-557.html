<p>As we can really only think in three dimensions well (some mathematicians can visualize some higher dimensions, but not too many!), we can't think of a ten-thousand as a four-dimensional object. However, we can "reunitize" and think of the thousand as a new type of unit. Then, one ten-thousand <span class="process-math">\(10 \times 1000=10 \times 10^3 = 10^4\)</span> can be visualized as a "long" made up of ten-thousands, a hundred-thousand <span class="process-math">\(10^5\)</span> can be viewed as a square made up of ten ten-thousands. We "reunitize" again when we hit one million, and reunitize after every three places. This may be why we decided to express places in "name", "ten-name", and "hundred-name".</p>
