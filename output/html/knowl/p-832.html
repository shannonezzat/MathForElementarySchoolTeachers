<p>Part of our study of these algorithms will involve being able to "picture" what is happening using blocks. Teachers could indeed use manipulatives so students can get a feel for the underpinnings of each algorithm that we will study. However, the author believes that students should not rely on the manipulatives to perform these algorithms. For many reasons, including speed and working with students towards the ideas of abstraction, being able to use the algorithms, while still being able to explain why they work as they do, is the best approach.</p>
