<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Let's subtract <span class="process-math">\(4052-2457\text{.}\)</span> We first write the numbers aligned vertically, and view each number in terms of place value blocks:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now let's subtract the rightmost place. Note that the top 2 is smaller than the bottom digit, so we must borrow. The the place directly to the left has a non-zero top digit, so we regroup 1 of this place (tens) to make 10 of our current place (ones) and thus decrease the digit in that place by 1. Now we have <span class="process-math">\(2+10=12\)</span> ones and we do the subtraction <span class="process-math">\(12-7=5\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now we move to the next place to the left; the tens place. Note that the top digit is now a 4, so it is smaller than the bottom digit 5. So again, we must borrow.</p>
<p>We have a zero immediately to the left of the (what was a 5 but is now a) 4, so we move to the left one more time (to the thousands place) since there is a non-zer digit in the top number there. We borrow one thousand, thus decreasing the thousands digit by 1, and ungroup that into 9 hundreds and 10 tens. In our calculation, this means changing the zero in the hundreds place in the top number to a 9, and the 4 in the tens place to a 14.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now we have 14 tens and we do the subtraction in the tens column <span class="process-math">\(14-5=9\)</span> . Similarly, the top number in the hundreds and thousands place is smaller so we do those subtractions as well: <span class="process-math">\(9-4=5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3-2 = 1\)</span> respectively.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>As we have no non-zero digits to the left of the thousands place, we are finished and we know <span class="process-math">\(4052-2457=1595.\)</span></p></article></body>
