<p>It is important to study multiple algorithms for many reasons. Forst of all, understanding the details of an algorithm allows a teacher to explain how and why an algorithm works, as opposed to simply relying on some authoritative explanation like "follow these steps because they are the ones that work". Also, this understanding allows teachers to be able to find student's conceptual errors in arithmetic. Not only can they find mistakes, they can, along with discussions with the students, also determine the conceptual reasons behind these mistakes. Knowing the underpinnings of multiple algorithms allows a teacher to have many algorithmic tools in their toolbox. They can use their professional judgement for what is the most appropriate algorithm to use and/or teach depending on the needs of their students.</p>
