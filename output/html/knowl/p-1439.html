<p>Percent represents a part of a whole, while percent change represents the degree of change over time. Percent change is calculated by taking the difference between the new value and the old value, dividing by the old value, and then multiplying by 100. Understanding the difference between percent and percent change is critical in contexts such as financial analysis, where it's important to distinguish between the portion of a whole and the rate of change over a period. Percent change provides insights into trends, growth rates, and the relative impact of changes in values, which is essential for making informed decisions.</p>
