<p>Consider the equation <span class="process-math">\(3x+4= 5-6x\)</span> which is made of two expressions, <span class="process-math">\(3x+4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5-6x\)</span> . In the term <span class="process-math">\(3x\)</span> on the left hand side (or LHS) of the coefficient is <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> and in the term <span class="process-math">\(-6x\)</span> on the right hand side (or RHS) of the equation the coefficient is <span class="process-math">\(-6\)</span> (here, we are viewing <span class="process-math">\(5-6x\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(5+(-6)x\text{.}\)</span> We will be more precise about this later in the book.)</p>
<p>Sometimes we can have unknown coefficients even in terms with variables, but we specify that these are indeed coefficients. For example, we could have the expression <span class="process-math">\(ax+by\)</span> where we are thinking of <span class="process-math">\(x,y\)</span> as our variables and <span class="process-math">\(a,b \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> as our coefficients.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-ProblemSolving.html#example-22">in-context</a></span>
