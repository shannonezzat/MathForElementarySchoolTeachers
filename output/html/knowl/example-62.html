<p>Let's calculate <span class="process-math">\(2201_{four} - 1332_{four}\)</span> and since we are still getting used to arithmetic in other bases, let's draw some base four blocks to represent our calculation.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THE STANDARD SETUP AND BLOCKS REPRESENTING THE SITUATION</p>
<p>We start from the ones digit on the right. Since the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, we must borrow. The first non-zero digit to the left is the 2 (in the squares, or sixteens, place). We ungroup <span class="process-math">\(1_{four}\)</span> sixteen (square) to <span class="process-math">\(3_{four}\)</span> fours (longs) and <span class="process-math">\(10_{four}\)</span> ones (remember that <span class="process-math">\(10_{four}\)</span> represents the number "four"). We can see this since <span class="process-math">\(16 = 3 \times 4 + 4 \times 1\text{,}\)</span> similar to our situation in the previous example in base ten. Thus we decrease the squares digit in the top number by 1 and replace the 0 in the longs place by a 3, and thus we have <span class="process-math">\(11_{four}\)</span> ones (which, in base four, is five ones).</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now, we can do the subtraction in the ones place <span class="process-math">\(11_{four} - 2_{four} = 3_{four} \text{,}\)</span> since we can see that <span class="process-math">\(2_{four}+3_{four} = 11_{four}\text{.}\)</span> We can subtract the longs digit as well: <span class="process-math">\(3_{four} - 3_{four} = 0 _{four}\text{.}\)</span> We write these down in our calculation.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Now, in the squares place, the digit 1 in the top number is smaller than the 3 in the bottom number, so we need to borrow again. We ungroup <span class="process-math">\(1_{four}\)</span> cube (or sixty-four) to <span class="process-math">\(10_{four}\)</span> squares, decreasing our 2 cubes to 1 cube.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Thus we now have <span class="process-math">\(10_{four}+1_{four} = 11_{four}\)</span> squares and can now do our subtraction <span class="process-math">\(11_{four}-3_{four} = 2_{four}\text{.}\)</span> We can also do the subtraction in the cubes place: <span class="process-math">\(1_{four}-1_{four} = 0_{four}\text{.}\)</span> We now have our final difference: <span class="process-math">\(2201_{four} - 1332_{four} = 203_{four}.\text{.}\)</span></p>
