<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> be the greatest common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> By the quotient-remainder theorem, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> can be expressed as <span class="process-math">\(a = qb + r\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is the quotient and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the remainder, and <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq r &lt; b\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> divides both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> it also divides <span class="process-math">\(a - qb\)</span> (which is equal to <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span>). Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> divides <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> Now, if there exists a larger common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> it would also divide <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(a = qb + r\)</span>), contradicting the fact that <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is the greatest common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is also the greatest common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Repeating this process iteratively, we reduce the problem to finding the GCD of smaller and smaller pairs of numbers, until the remainder <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> becomes zero. At that point, the GCD of the original pair <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is the non-zero remainder from the previous division.</p>
<p>This completes the proof that the Euclidean Algorithm correctly computes the GCD of two positive integers.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-FactorsAndMultiples.html#euclidean_algorithm_proof">in-context</a></span>
