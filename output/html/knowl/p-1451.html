<p>In the last section, we were able to develop divisibility rules for powers of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> since powers of <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> are divisible by <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> We could use this commonality between each power of <span class="process-math">\(10\text{,}\)</span> and thus each place value in a number, to come up with a simplified rule for determining divisibility of these powers of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> In this section, we will look for another consistant commonality between powers of 10 being divided by <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> that will allow us to develop divisibility rules for these numbers. The next example will walk you through noticing the pattern.</p>
