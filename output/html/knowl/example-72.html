<p>Let's do the base twelve division computation <span class="process-math">\(54A87 \div A.\text{.}\)</span> Remember here that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is our symbol for "ten". Our base twelve multiplication table will help a lot, so we include it here for easy reference:</p>
<p>INCLUDE BASE TWELVE TIMES TABLE</p>
<p>We write down our dividend and divisor in the appropraite locations. Now we perform the algorithm. We start at the <span class="process-math">\(10^4_{twelve}\)</span> place (a long made of cubes) and ask "if we have 5 of this place, how many can be evenly divided among ten groups." We do not have enough to put any in the groups, so we put a zero in the quotient above this place (however, we don't need to explicity write it since we do not write whole numbers starting with a zero). We have grouped <span class="process-math">\(0 \times A = 0 \)</span> of this place, and have <span class="process-math">\(5-0=0\)</span> remaining.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Each of this place can be ungrouped to twelve (that is <span class="process-math">\(10_{twelve}\)</span>) of the place to the right. So we ungroup these to have <span class="process-math">\(5 \times 10 + 4 = 54\)</span> of the next place value, which is <span class="process-math">\(10^3_{twelve}\)</span> (that is, cubes). Similarly we ask "if we have <span class="process-math">\(54_{twelve}\)</span> of this place, how many can be evenly divided among ten groups?" Using our multiplication table we see that <span class="process-math">\(6 \times A = 50\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(7 \times A = 5A\)</span> thus the most we can put in our groups is <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> cubes. Thus we have grouped <span class="process-math">\(6 \times A = 50\)</span> and have <span class="process-math">\(54-50 = 4\)</span> cubes remaining.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>We now ungroup these <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> cubes into forty-eight, or <span class="process-math">\(40_{twelve}\)</span> squares and add these to the <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> squares we originally have. Similarly, since <span class="process-math">\(5 \times A = 42\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(6 \times A = 50\)</span> we know that we can evenly put <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> squares in each of our <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> groups, and we have <span class="process-math">\(4A-42=8\)</span> squares remaining.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>We ungroup these <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> squares to make ninety-six (or <span class="process-math">\(80_{twelve}\)</span>) longs. Adding our original <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> longs we have <span class="process-math">\(80+8==88\)</span> longs. Similarly to the previous places, we know <span class="process-math">\(A \times A = 84\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B \times A = 92\)</span> so we can evenly put <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> longs in each of our <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> groups, and we have <span class="process-math">\(88-84=4\)</span> remaining.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p>Finally, we ungroup these <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> longs to make <span class="process-math">\(40_{twelve}\)</span> ones. Adding our original <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> ones we have <span class="process-math">\(47\)</span> ones in total. Since <span class="process-math">\(5 \times A = 42\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(6 \times A = 50\)</span> we know that we can evenly put <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> ones in each of our <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> groups, and we have <span class="process-math">\(47-42=5\)</span> remaining. We have reached the ones place, so we are finished. Thus <span class="process-math">\(54A87 \div A = 65A5R5.\)</span></p>
