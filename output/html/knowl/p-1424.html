<p>A percent is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word "percent" comes from the Latin "per centum," which means "by the hundred." This means that percents are inherently tied to the concept of fractions and ratios. For instance, 50% is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(50/100\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(0.5\text{.}\)</span> In practical terms, this means that 50% represents half of a given quantity. Understanding percents as fractions helps in visualizing parts of a whole, making it easier to compare and analyze data. Similarly, percents can also be viewed as ratios, where 50% means 50 parts out of 100 parts. This ratio perspective is particularly useful in fields like statistics and probability, where relationships between quantities are often examined.</p>
