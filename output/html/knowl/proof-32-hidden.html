<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Assume for the sake of contradiction that <span class="process-math">\(r \times i\)</span> is a rational number. Since the set of rational numbers is closed under multiplication and division, we can write:</p>
<p><span class="process-math">\(r \times i = q\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is a rational number.</p>
<p>We can then divide both sides of the equation by <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(r \neq 0\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="process-math">\(i = \frac{q}{r}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since both <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> are rational numbers, and the quotient of two rational numbers is also rational, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{q}{r}\)</span> must be rational.</p>
<p>This implies that <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is rational, which contradicts our initial assumption that <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> is irrational. Therefore, our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(r \times i\)</span> is rational must be false, and <span class="process-math">\(r \times i\)</span> is indeed irrational.</p></article></body>
