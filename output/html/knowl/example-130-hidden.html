<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>We know that <span class="process-math">\(35=5 \times 7\)</span> , so we know that <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> divides <span class="process-math">\(35\text{.}\)</span> We can also say <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(35\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(35\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(5\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(35\)</span> is divisible by <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> These all express the same information. Additionally, <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> is a proper factor of <span class="process-math">\(35\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(35\)</span> are not.</p>
<p>You've probably spotted that we can say the same things about <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> as we did about <span class="process-math">\(35\text{.}\)</span> This idea gives us our first theorem, that we will state and prove more formally after we develop some notation for the concept of divisibility.</p></article></body>
