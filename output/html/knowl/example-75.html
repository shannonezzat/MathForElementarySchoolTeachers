<p>Let's multiply <span class="process-math">\(348 \times 97\text{.}\)</span> First, we write the numbers lined up by place value, but we are thinking of the bottom number in expanded form: <span class="process-math">\((349) \times (90 + 7). \)</span> Pictorally, we can view this as breaking up a rectangle with side lengths <span class="process-math">\(348\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(97\)</span> units into sub rectangles where the side length of <span class="process-math">\(97\)</span> are the terms in the expanded form.</p>
<p>INCLUDE PICTURE HERE</p>
<p>We start at the right hand side of the bottom number, with our aim being to calculate <span class="process-math">\(7 \times 348\text{.}\)</span> Since that digit is in the ones place, we do not write down any zeroes yet. We multiply it by each digit in the top number and add any regroupings to the next place: <span class="process-math">\(7 \times 8 = 56\)</span> so we write down the <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> and "carry" the <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> to the tens place.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Next, we multiply the our ones digit by the tens place, and add the regrouping: <span class="process-math">\(7 \times 4 + 5 =28 +5 = 33\text{.}\)</span> We write down the <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> to the  left of the <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> and carry the other three to the hundreds place.</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Now, we multiply the hundreds place: <span class="process-math">\(7 \times 3 + 3 = 21+3=24\text{.}\)</span> As there is no (non-zero) digit to the left, we write both digits down to the left of the <span class="process-math">\(3\text{.}\)</span> Thus we have calculated <span class="process-math">\(7 \times 348 = 2436.\)</span></p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Now we move to the tens digit of the bottom number. Our aim is now to calculate <span class="process-math">\(90 \times 348\text{.}\)</span> Since the <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> is in the tens place, we first write a <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> in the right-most spot (we know that <span class="process-math">\(90 \times 348 = 10 \times (9 \times 348)\)</span> so this <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> signifies that we have taken out a factor of <span class="process-math">\(10\text{.}\)</span>)</p>
<p>We start with <span class="process-math">\(9 \times 8 = 72\text{.}\)</span> So we write down the <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and "carry" the <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> to the next place value. Note that this <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> actually signifies <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> hundreds since we are really calculating <span class="process-math">\(90 \times 8 = 720\text{.}\)</span> Similar to the first digit of the bottom number, we have <span class="process-math">\(9 \times 4 + 7 = 43\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(9 \times 3 + 4 = 31\text{.}\)</span> Thus we have calculated <span class="process-math">\(90 \times 348 = 31320\)</span></p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Now that we are out of non-zero digits in the bottom number, we simply add the two partial products we have calculated: <span class="process-math">\(2436+31320 = 33756\)</span></p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>Note that our first partial sum is the same as the <span class="process-math">\(56+280+2100\)</span> in the partial sum algorithm, and similarly <span class="process-math">\(31320 = 720 + 3600 + 27,000 \text{.}\)</span> We can see this relationship in the diagram too</p>
