<p>Let's do "if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even then <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is even" first. Then we'll find that it's easier to prove the inverse statement "if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd then <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> is odd" than the converse.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be even. Then <span class="process-math">\(n=2k\)</span> for some whole number <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> We want to show that <span class="process-math">\(n^2 = 2(\text{integer})\)</span> which would show that it is always even when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even. Consider</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(2k^2\)</span> is a whole number, we have written <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> as an even whole number.</p>

<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be odd. Then <span class="process-math">\(n=2k+1\)</span> for some whole number <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> We want to show that <span class="process-math">\(n^2 = 2(\text{integer})+1\)</span> which would show that it is always odd when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd. Consider</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = (2k+1)(2k+1) = 4k^2+4k+1 = 2(2k^2+2k)+1.

</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(2k^2+2k\)</span> is a whole number, we have written <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> as an odd whole number.</p>

</ol>
<p>Since we showed that both the original statement and its inverse are true, we have showed the biconditional statement is true.</p>
