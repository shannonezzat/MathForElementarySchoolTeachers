<p>A quick reminder about the order of operations that occur in an expression. These have been universally agreed upon over time, so we should make sure we're comfortable with this.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Perform operations inside of brackets (using the ordering we are listing) in the order they occur, left to right.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform exponential and root operations in the order they occur, left to right.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform divisions and multiplications in the order they occur, left to right.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform addition and subtraction in the order they occur, left to right.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">You have probabily heard the expression BEDMAS as a reminder of the order. More precisely, it should read BE(DM)(AS), as we think of division and multiplication, and addition and subtraction, as pairs of the same operations (as each member of the pair is the inverse operation of the other member.)</p>
