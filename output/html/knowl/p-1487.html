<p>Let's try and prove this. It's similar to Theorem 1, and in fact, Theorem 1 can be looked at as a repeated application of Theorem 2. Let's say we know that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is a factor of both <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Then we can express both <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> dots as a rectangle, with one of the dimensions being <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> and the other we'll call <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> respectively. Then in the addition case, we can "glue" the two rectangles together to make a rectangle with dimensions <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b+c\text{.}\)</span> INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
