<p>We need to find the greatest prime less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{293}\text{.}\)</span> Without a calculator, we can bound <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{293}\)</span> between two consecutive primes, or put another way, bound <span class="process-math">\(293\)</span> between two squares od primes.</p>
<p>We know that <span class="process-math">\(17^2=289\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(19^2=361\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(17 \leq \sqrt{293} \leq 19\text{,}\)</span> and our <span class="process-math">\(p_*=17\)</span></p>
<p>We now check if each prime less than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{293}\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(293\text{:}\)</span></p>
<p>2: Since <span class="process-math">\(2 \nmid 3\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(2 \nmid 293.\)</span></p>
<p>3: Since <span class="process-math">\(3 \nmid (2+9+3)\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(3 \nmid 293\)</span></p>
<p>5: Since <span class="process-math">\(5 \nmid 3\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(5 \nmid 293\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>7: By division, we know that <span class="process-math">\(293 \div 7 = 41R6\text{.}\)</span> Since we have a non-zero remainder, we know <span class="process-math">\(7 /nmid 293\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>11: Since <span class="process-math">\(11 \nmid (2-9+3)\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(11 \nmid 293\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>13: By division we know that <span class="process-math">\(293 \div 13 = 22R7\text{.}\)</span> Since we have a non-zero remiander, we know <span class="process-math">\(13 \nmid 293\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>17: By division we know that <span class="process-math">\(293 \div 17 = 17R4\text{.}\)</span> Since we have a non-zero remainder we know that <span class="process-math">\(17 \nmid 293\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We have checked the divisibility of all primes up to and including <span class="process-math">\(17\text{.}\)</span> Since we have found that none are factors of <span class="process-math">\(293\)</span> our test for primality guarantees us that <span class="process-math">\(293\)</span> is prime.</p>
