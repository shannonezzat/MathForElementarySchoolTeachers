<p>First, calculate the points earned from each part of the course using proportions:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Assignments: <span class="process-math">\(\frac{x}{10}=\frac{65}{100}\text{.}\)</span> Solving for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by cross multiplication we get that <span class="process-math">\(x=6.5\)</span>  points, or 65% of the assignment points.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly for the first midterm: 25 * 0.85 = 21.25 points, or 85% of the first midterm points</p></li>
<li><p>Second midterm: 20 * 0.55 = 11 points, or 55% of the second midterm points</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The total points earned so far are 6.5 + 21.25 + 11 = 38.75 points. This is a proportion of 38.75 / 100 = 0.3875, or 38.75%, of the total course points.</p>
<p>To reach the goal of 70 points, which is a proportion of 70 / 100 = 0.7, or 70%, of the total course points, 70 - 38.75 = 31.25 points are needed.</p>
<p>The final exam is worth the remaining 45 points. To find out the required percentage grade on the final exam, we set up a proportion where 31.25 points is to 45 points as the unknown percentage (x) is to 100%:</p>
<p>31.25 / 45 = x / 100</p>
<p>Solving for x gives approximately 69.44%. Therefore, a grade of approximately 69.44% is needed on the final exam to reach the total course mark of 70%.</p>
