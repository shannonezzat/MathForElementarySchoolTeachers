<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>A usual rule in most Canadian provinces is "If you are drinking alcohol then you must be at least 19 years old". Which of the following people may be violating this rule?</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>A 20 year old</p></li>
<li><p>A person drinking a beer</p></li>
<li><p>A person drinking water</p></li>
<li><p>A 16 year old</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Intuitively, most people know that you would need to check the person drinking beer, and the 16 year old. The person drinking a beer may be under 19, and the 16 year old may be drinking alcohol. Let's analyse this using the idea of a counterexample:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>The 20 year old satisfies the condition "then-part true". Since the only time a conditional statement is false is when the "if-part" is true and the "then-part" false, this can never be a counterexample.</p></li>
<li><p>The person drinking a beer satisfies the condition "if-part true". If they also satisfy "then-part false" (so they are under 19 years old) then they would be a counterexample to the rule. You would check this person.</p></li>
<li><p>The person drinking water satisfies "if-part false". Just like with 1, there is no possibility thay they can be a counterexample.</p></li>
<li><p>The 16 year old satisfies "then part false". If they are also drinking (the "if-part" true) then they are a counterexample. You would check this person.</p></li>
