<p>Since we don't have the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> we need to factor it completely into its prime factorization. There are many ways of doing this, but we can usse our divisibility tests to determine some small factors, and then once our divisibility tests fail, we can use trial division to determine other prime factors.</p>
<p>First, it's worth noting that by our divisibility test for <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(3 \nmid n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We first notice that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> ends in two zeros, so we know that <span class="process-math">\(100 | n\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(100=2^2 \times 5^2\)</span> we can write <span class="process-math">\(n=(2^2 \times 5^2)301,774\text{.}\)</span> We now look for more prime factors of <span class="process-math">\(301,774.\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(301,774\)</span> ends in an even digit, we know that <span class="process-math">\(2 | 301,774\)</span> and by division we can determine that <span class="process-math">\(301,174=2 \times 150,887. \)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(n=(2^{2+1} \times 5^2) \times 150,887\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Next we may notice that <span class="process-math">\(1-5+0-8+8-7=-11\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(11 | 150,887\text{.}\)</span> By division we see that <span class="process-math">\(150887=11 \times 13717\text{.}\)</span> We then notice that <span class="process-math">\(1-3+7-1+7=11\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(11 | 13717\)</span> and, again by division, <span class="process-math">\(13717=11 \times  1247\text{.}\)</span> Putting this together we have <span class="process-math">\(n =(2^3 \times 5^2 \times 11^2) \times 1247.\)</span></p>
<p>We can check all of our divisiblity tests and find that <span class="process-math">\(1247\)</span> fails all of them. So by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/assemblage-TestForPrimality.html" title="Summary: Teat For Primality">Summary </a>we need to determine if <span class="process-math">\(1247\)</span> has any prime factors great than 11. We note that <span class="process-math">\(31^2 = 961\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(37^2 = 1369\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(31\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(37\)</span> are consecutive primes so <span class="process-math">\(31 &lt; \sqrt{1247} &lt; 37\)</span> so we need to check all prime numbers of size <span class="process-math">\(31\)</span> and smaller. We've already checked <span class="process-math">\(2,3,5,11\)</span> so we need to check <span class="process-math">\(7,13,17,19,23,29,31\)</span> by trial division.</p>
<p>Using this trial division, we see that <span class="process-math">\(1247 \div 29=43\text{,}\)</span> so we know that <span class="process-math">\(29\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> And since <span class="process-math">\(43\)</span> is also prime, we have decomposed <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> into its prime factorization: <span class="process-math">\(n = 2^3 \times 5^2 \times 11^2 \times 29 \times 43\text{.}\)</span> Thus by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-NumberOfFactors.html" title="Theorem 6.4.11">Theorem 6.4.11</a> we see that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\((3+1)(2+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=144\)</span> total factors. Of these factors, <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> are prime, <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is the number <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(138\)</span> are composite.</p>
