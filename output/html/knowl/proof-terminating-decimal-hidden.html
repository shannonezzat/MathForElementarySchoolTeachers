<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Since this is an "if and only if" statement in the form <span class="process-math">\(P \leftrightarrow Q\text{,}\)</span> we have to prove two results, <span class="process-math">\(P \rightarrow Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q \rightarrow P\text{.}\)</span>  Let's denote a rational number as a/b, where a and b are integers and b â‰  0. We want to show that a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.</p>
<p>Suppose a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal. Then, by definition of a terminating decimal, a/b can be written as a decimal with a finite number of digits. This means that a/b can be expressed as a decimal fraction, because a decimal fraction is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10, and any terminating decimal can be expressed in this form.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose a/b is equivalent to a decimal fraction. Then a/b can be expressed as a decimal with a finite number of digits, because a decimal fraction is a fraction where the denominator is a power of 10, and any fraction with a denominator that is a power of 10 can be expressed as a terminating decimal. Therefore, a/b is equivalent to a terminating decimal.</p>
<p>Putting both results together, a rational number is equivalent to a terminating decimal if and only if it is equivalent to a decimal fraction.</p></article></body>
