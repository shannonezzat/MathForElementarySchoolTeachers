<p>To compare two fractions with different denominators, we can find equivalent fractions that have the same denominator. The way to do this so that the denominators are as small as possible is by finding least common denominator (LCD), which is the smallest multiple of both denomnators. More precisely, if <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> are two denominators, then the <dfn class="terminology">least common denominator</dfn> is smallest number <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f=xb=yd\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(x,y \in \mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, if we wanted <span class="process-math">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{c}{d}\)</span> to have a common denominator, we multiply the top and bottom of the first fraction by <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and the second fraction by <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> to get <span class="process-math">\(\frac{ax}{bx}=\frac{ax}{f}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{cy}{dy}=\frac{cy}{f}\text{.}\)</span> Now both quantities are fractions that have the same denominator.</p>
