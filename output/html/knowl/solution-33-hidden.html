<p>Note the this is an if-then statement. So we need to show that it's never the case that the if-part is true and the then-part is false. But, in the definition of subsets we have additional if-then statements as well, so we have to be careful with these "nested" conditional statements.</p>
<p>Let's assume the if-part is true: that <span class="process-math">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B \subseteq C\text{.}\)</span> So this means that if <span class="process-math">\(x \in A\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \in B\)</span> (since A is a subset of B) and if <span class="process-math">\(x \in B\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \in C\)</span> (since B is a subset of C).</p>
<p>We need to show that the then-part is true; that A is a subset of C, so if <span class="process-math">\(x \in A\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x \in C\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>So now, using the if-part assumption, let's show that the then-part is true. Let <span class="process-math">\(x \in A\text{.}\)</span> By our assumption that <span class="process-math">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(x \in B\text{.}\)</span> Now, by the second part of our assumption, that <span class="process-math">\(B \subseteq C\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(x \in C\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since we started with an element of A and showed that it must be an element of C, we have shown the then-aprt; that <span class="process-math">\(A \subseteq C\text{,}\)</span> and this means we've proved that the if-then statement is always true.</p>
<p>Note that you can see this visually using the following Venn diagram:</p>
