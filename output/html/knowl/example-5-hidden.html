<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Let's write the number 77 in base five. First, we make as many groups of five as we can:</p>
<p>INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p>We have divided the 77 ones into 15 groups of five (longs) with 2 remaining.</p>
<p>Now we group our 15 longss into groups of five, giving us groups of twenty-five, or squares:</p>
<p>Now we have 3 squares, and 2 ones. Can we write this as <span class="process-math">\(32_{five}\text{?}\)</span> No! Be careful here. We are missing a place; we have no fives, so we need to indicate that with the digit 0: so we should write <span class="process-math">\(302_{five}\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(32_{five}\)</span> is 3 fives and 2 ones, which is 17. This is why that 0 digit is important!</p></article></body>
