<p>Note that we will also learn how to use these algorithms to do arithmetic in other bases, as discussined in INSERT SECTION REFERENCE. Even though it may be unlikely that you will need to teach students how to do arithmetic in other bases, this will allow us to turn off our "muscle memory" of doing arithmetic in base ten, as we are so comfortable with many of these algorithms that it is incredibly difficult to this muscle memory off to think deeply about the algorithmeic underpinnings. As an added bonus, we will get to experience, in a small way, the struggles that your future students will have when learning about performing arithmetic for the first time.</p>
