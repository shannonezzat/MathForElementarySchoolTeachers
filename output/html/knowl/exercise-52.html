<li><p>Let's start to think about numbers divisible by both, noting that <span class="process-math">\(6=2 \times 3\text{.}\)</span> Using a calculator if you wish, write down around 10 or 20 examples of numbers with both 2 and 3 as factors (can you think about how to easily make these?). Are these numbers also divisible by 6? Check!</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven't found one above, can you think of a number that is divisible by 2 and 3 but not divisible by 6?</p></li>

<li><p>Let's try another number, say <span class="process-math">\(24=6 \times 4\text{.}\)</span> Write down many numbers with both 6 and 4 as factors. Is 24 also a factor of these numbers? Check!</p></li>

<li><p>Try the above with other sets of numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> for example try <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 5=15\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 4=8\text{.}\)</span> Do you notice a pattern about  the numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a \times b\)</span> is always a factor of numbers where both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are factors, and when there are numbers that do not have <span class="process-math">\(a \times b\)</span> as a factor?</p></li>
