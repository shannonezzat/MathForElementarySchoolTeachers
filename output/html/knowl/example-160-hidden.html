<li><p>Let's start with the primes <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and put them into the set <span class="process-math">\(A = \{2,3\}.\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Let's make a new number by multiplying all numbers in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and then adding <span class="process-math">\(1:\text{,}\)</span> say <span class="process-math">\(a=2 \times 3+1=7\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lem-PrimePlus1.html" title="Lemma 6.3.4">LemmaÂ 6.3.4</a> we know that <span class="process-math">\(2 \nmid 7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3 \nmid 7\)</span> (although this is pretty obvious anyway). So <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is not divisible by any prime numbers in our set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is either prime itself, or a product of other primes that aren't already in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In this case <span class="process-math">\(a=7\)</span> is prime.</p></li>
<li><p>We now redefine <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to include our new prime (or primes if <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> had other prime factors.) So in this case now <span class="process-math">\(A:=A \cup \{7\} = \{2,3\} \cup \{7\} = \{2,3,7\}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We then repear the procedure with the new <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to obtain <span class="process-math">\(a=2\times 3\times 7+1 = 43\text{,}\)</span> which itself is prime, so we include it in our set as well; <span class="process-math">\(A=\{2,3,7,43\}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Let's do this again: now <span class="process-math">\(a=2\times 3 \times 7 \times 43+1 = 1807\text{.}\)</span> You can check that <span class="process-math">\(1807=13 \times 139\)</span> which are both prime, so we can add <span class="process-math">\(13\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(39 \)</span> to our set: <span class="process-math">\(A=\{2,3,7,13,39,43\}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We can continue this process, and at each step we will form a number <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> that has no numbers in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as a factor, so we will be able to add at least one more prime number (either <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> itself if it is prime, or the prime factors of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> if it is not) to our set.</p></li>
<li><p>As our set grows by at least one number every iteration of this process, we know we can always include at least one more prime number in our set. So we will never run out of prime numbers, and thus there are infinitely many prime numbers.</p></li>
