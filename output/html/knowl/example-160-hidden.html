<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be a non-square number. This means that in its prime factorization, there is at least one prime that has a power that isn't a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> For example, if <span class="process-math">\(n=60=2^2 \times 3 \times 5\text{.}\)</span> Here both <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> have an exponent of one, which isn't a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{.}\)</span> We'll pick the smallest of these primes with such an exponent and call that prime <span class="process-math">\(p_*\)</span> with exponent <span class="process-math">\(2e_*+1\)</span> for some  <span class="process-math">\(e_* \in \mathbb{N}_0\)</span> and we can write <span class="process-math">\(n=p_*^{2e_*+1}k\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the "rest" of the factors of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> In our example, <span class="process-math">\(p_*=3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e_*=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(60=3^1 \times (2^2 \times 5)\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(k=2^2 \times 5\)</span> in this example.</p>
<p>We will show this by contradiction; let's pretend that we can indeed write <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> as a rational number: <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}=\frac{a}{b}\)</span> for some appropriate integers <span class="process-math">\(a,b\text{.}\)</span> In our example, we let <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{60}=\frac{a}{b}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Let's arrange our equation so that we have no roots or denominators: this means multiplying both sides by <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and then squaring both sides of the equation:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{n}=\frac{a}{b} \rightarrow \sqrt{n}b=a \rightarrow nb^2=a^2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In our example:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{60}=\frac{a}{b} \rightarrow \sqrt{60}b=a \rightarrow 60b^2=a^2. 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Let's count the number of factors of <span class="process-math">\(p_*\)</span> on both sides of the equation. On the RHS, by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-nthPower.html" title="Theorem 7.2.10">Theorem 7.2.10</a> we know that <span class="process-math">\(a^2\)</span> has an even number of <span class="process-math">\(p_*\text{,}\)</span> and thus the exponent <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(p_*\)</span> in the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(b^2\)</span> is a factor of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> so say <span class="process-math">\(e=2r\)</span> for some natural numnber <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(b^2=p_*^{2r}j\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> are the "rest" of the factors of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>However, on the LHS, by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm-nthPower.html" title="Theorem 7.2.10">Theorem 7.2.10</a> we also know that <span class="process-math">\(b^2\)</span> has an even exponent for <span class="process-math">\(p_*\)</span> in it's prime factorization, say <span class="process-math">\(2s\)</span> for some natural number <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and similarly to <span class="process-math">\(a^2\)</span> we can say <span class="process-math">\(b^2=p_*^{2s}\ell\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(ell\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> itself has an odd exponent for <span class="process-math">\(p_*\text{.}\)</span> Thus</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
nb^2 = (p_*^{2e_*+1}k)(p_*^{2s}\ell) = p_*^{2e_*+1+2s}k\ell = p_*^{2(e_*+s)+1}kl.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">In our example:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
60b^2 = (3^{1} (2^2 \times 5))(3^{2s}\ell) = 3^{2s+1}[(2^2 \times 5)\ell].
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Putting this together:</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
p_*^{2(e_*+s)+1}kl = p_*^{2r}j.  
\end{equation*}
</div> However, the exponent of <span class="process-math">\(p_*\)</span> on the LHS is not a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> while the exponent on the RHS is (this is true in our example too). So the only way that we can write <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> as a rational number is if we can have an even and odd exponent of <span class="process-math">\(p_*\)</span> in the prime factorization of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> But we know it must be one or the other since prime factorizations are unique by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. So this is a contradiction, and what we started with must be incorrect; that is, we cannot write <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> as a rational number.</article></body>
