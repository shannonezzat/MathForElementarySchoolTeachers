<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p><span class="process-math">\(3x+4 = 6x-7\)</span> is a linear equation since each term has (at most) one copy of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(3x+4y=7\)</span> is another linear equation since both <span class="process-math">\(3x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4y\)</span> have exactly one copy of <span class="process-math">\(x,y\)</span> in them, and <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> has no <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>'s or <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>'s.</p>
<p>Now a non-example: <span class="process-math">\(3xy-4x^2=6\)</span> is *not* a linear equation. Here there are two problems (onte that just one is enough to disqualify it from being a linear equation): the first term has two variables in it, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Also the second term has two copies of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> multiplied together, since by the definition of exponents <span class="process-math">\(x^2 = x \times x.\)</span></p></article></body>
