<p>Here are the solutions:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>To find the unit rate, divide the total miles by the total hours. So, 240 miles รท 4 hours = <span class="process-math">\(60 miles/hour\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>First, let's create a proportion using the ratio 5:3 (cars:trucks) and the information we know (20 cars and unknown number of trucks). Set up the proportion like this: 5/3 = 20/x. Cross-multiply and solve for x, you'll get <span class="process-math">\(x = 12\)</span> trucks.</p></li>
<li><p>The original recipe has a ratio of 2:1 for flour to sugar. Since you want to make a half batch and the full recipe needs 4 cups of flour, a half batch will require 2 cups of flour. Because the ratio is 2:1, for every 2 cups of flour, you need 1 cup of sugar. So for a half batch, you will need <span class="process-math">\(1 cup of sugar\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Use the idea of proportions to find out how many points the student has already secured in each category (assignments, better midterm, and other midterm), then figure out how many points they need to reach their target grade of 80%. Compute the points needed on the final by subtracting the points already secured from the target points. Convert this into a percentage by creating a proportion with 100, then solve for x. This will be the score they need on the final exam. The exact percentage will depend on the specific values you calculate.</p></li>
