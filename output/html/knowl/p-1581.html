<p>We are going to show this result is true using a <dfn class="terminology">proof by contradiction</dfn>. As in part 3 of <a href="sec-ConditionalStatements.html#subsec-JustifyingConditionalStatements" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.2.2: Justifying Conditional Statements">SubsectionÂ 1.2.2</a>, we are going to pretend that there is a counterexample to our conditional statement (that is, the only situation where <span class="process-math">\(P \to Q\)</span> is false; when <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is false.) We will show that if we are in this case, then mathematics "breaks" and we end up with something that is never true. This means that there are no counterexamples to our statement, so it must always be true. In our case, we will end up with showing that <span class="process-math">\(n &gt; n\text{,}\)</span> which is always false; of course, no number is strictly greater than itself!. The idea will be that if we multiply two number bigger than <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span> together, we must get a number bigger than <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span></p>
