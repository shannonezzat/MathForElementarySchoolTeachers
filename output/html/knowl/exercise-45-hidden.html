<body class="ignore-math"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Let's practice more with what we've learned about ratios, rates, and proportions. Here are some problems for you to solve.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If a car travels 240 miles in 4 hours, what is the unit rate (miles per hour)?</p></li>
<li><p>Jacky's toy car collection has a ratio of 5:3 of cars to trucks. If she has 20 cars, how many trucks does she have?</p></li>
<li><p>In a recipe, the ratio of cups of flour to cups of sugar is 2:1. If you want to make a half batch of the recipe and the full recipe requires 4 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar will you need?</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that a class's grading scheme consists of assignments worth 10%, the better midterm is worth 30%, the other midterm is worth 20%, and the final exam is worth 40%. If a student got 85% on the assignments, 80% on their better midterm, 70% on the other midterm, and they want to get an overall mark of 80%, what do they need to score on the final exam?</p></li>
