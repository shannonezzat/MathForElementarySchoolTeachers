<p>First, we find the largest prime <span class="process-math">\(p_* \leq \sqrt{n}\text{.}\)</span> If we have access to a calculator, we know that <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{403} \approx 20\text{.}\)</span> But if we do not, we can square primes and "sandwich" 403 between these squares. We know that <span class="process-math">\(19^2=361\)</span> and the subsequent prime <span class="process-math">\(23^2=529\text{.}\)</span> So this means that <span class="process-math">\(19 \leq \sqrt{403} \leq 23\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(19\)</span> is the largest prime that is less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{403}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We now test the divisibility of each prime up to <span class="process-math">\(19\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(403\text{.}\)</span> If none of these primes are a factor of <span class="process-math">\(403\)</span> then by our test for primality, <span class="process-math">\(403\)</span> is prime. We will do each prime individually, and when we have a divisibility rule to help us, we will use that.</p>
<p>2: Since <span class="process-math">\(2 \nmid 3\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(2 \nmid 403\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>3: Since <span class="process-math">\(3 \nmid (4+0+3)\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(3 \nmid 403\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>5: Since <span class="process-math">\(5 \nmid 3\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(5 \nmid 403\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>7: By division, we know that <span class="process-math">\(403 \div 7 = 57R4\text{.}\)</span> Since we have a non-zero remainder we know <span class="process-math">\(7 \nmid 403\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>11: Since <span class="process-math">\(11 \nmid 4-0+3\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(11 \nmid 403\)</span></p>
<p>13: By division, we know that <span class="process-math">\(403 \div 13 = 31\text{.}\)</span> So indeed <span class="process-math">\(13 \mid 403\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(403=13 \times 31\text{.}\)</span> We have foudn a prime factor of <span class="process-math">\(403\)</span> and thus by our test for primality, <span class="process-math">\(403\)</span> is not prime (and we have a factorization of it too!)</p>
<p>Note that once we find a prime that divides our number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we do not need to test the other primes; we already know that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is composite.</p>
