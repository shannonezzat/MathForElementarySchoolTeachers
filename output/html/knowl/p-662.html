<p>Note just like us defining subtraction in terms of something we already knew, we defined divison in terms of multiplication and addition. So we're on solid footing here; if we ever forget what division means, we just look up this definition which is in terms of multiplication and addition, which, if we forget, we can look up the definition of those too. This seems like it's overkill for such simple concepts (and it is in a way) but this is how mathematicians think about concepts so it's good practice to do this for easy and intuitive ideas like arithmetic.</p>
