<p>To prove an if-then statement is true, we need to show that the "dreaded case", where the if-part is true and the then-part is false, never happens. There are three main ways to do this:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Assume the if-part is true, and show that the then part *must* be true. Thus the "dreaded case" is impossible. This is called a <dfn class="terminology">direct proof</dfn>.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume the then-part is false, and show that the if-part *must* be false. Thus the "dreaded case" is impossible.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that there is an input that gives the "dreaded case" (where the if-part is true and the thenn-part is false) and show that some sort of contradition arises where mathemathics "breaks".</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">We will mainly focus on direct proofs in this book, though there are a few times where we will see a proof of another type. When we come across those, we will remind everyone of the logic behind those types of proofs.</p>
