<p>Of course, there are many ways of doing this, but one way is to draw a picture. There is a very good chance that you would do the same thing! Let's start by showing 12 is even:</p>
<p><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/MathForElementarySchoolTeachers%5Cassets%5CSection1%5CS1-Intro%20to%20Logic%5CChkpt1.22%5C1.jpg" class="contained" alt="2=2x6"></div></p>
<p>Here we took 12 dots and organized them as 6 rows of 2. Since 12 can be grouped evenly into rows of 2, we know that 12 is even. Hence, we can write <span class="process-math">\(12=2 \times 6.\)</span></p>
<p>In general, the number of rows of 2 isn't particularly important to say that a number is even; it's the fact that we can group the number into *some amount* of rows of 2. Usually we'll express this as <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> rows of 2. So for a even whole number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(n=2k\)</span> for some whole number <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p><figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/MathForElementarySchoolTeachers%5Cassets%5CSection1%5CS1-Intro%20to%20Logic%5CChkpt1.22%5C2.jpg" class="contained" alt="2k=2xk"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.1.23<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>To show 15 is odd, you probably drew a picture similar to this:</p>
<p><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/MathForElementarySchoolTeachers%5Cassets%5CSection1%5CS1-Intro%20to%20Logic%5CChkpt1.22%5C3.jpg" class="contained" alt="15=2x7+1"></div></p>
<p>Here we took the 15 dots and organized them into 7 rows of 2, but we had 1 dot remaining where we were unable to complete a full row of two. Hence, we can write <span class="process-math">\(15=2 \times 7 + 1.\)</span></p>
<p>Like for even numbers, the number of rows of 2 isn't particularly important to say that a number is odd; it's the fact that we can group the number into as many rows of 2 as possible, we always have 1 left over. Usually we'll express this as <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> rows of 2 + 1 remaining. So for a odd whole number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> we know <span class="process-math">\(n=2k+1\)</span> for some whole number <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p>
