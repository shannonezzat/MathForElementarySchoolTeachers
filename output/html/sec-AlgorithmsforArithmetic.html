</h2>
<section class="introduction" id="introduction-6"><p id="p-254">In this section, we will talk about the ways we do arithmetic in practice. If you think about it, the methods we use to do arithmetic are a series of steps (a good analogy is a recipe) that we follow to obtain an answer. In mathematics we care about these enough to give them their own name:</p>
<article class="definition definition-like" id="def-Algorithm"><h3 class="heading">

</h3>
<p id="p-255">An <dfn class="terminology">algorithm</dfn> is a (finite) series of well-defined steps that will always solve a certain class of problems if correctly followed.</p></article><p id="p-256">There are countless algorithms for solving arithmetic problems for whole numbers (which we can use to solve arithmetic problems in larger sets of numbers, like integers, rational numbers, or real numnbers). We will discuss a few of the most common algorithms that are used, discuss the pros and cons of each, and also discuss some non-algorithmic and ad-hoc methods that are widely used, especially when it comes to mental arithmetic.</p>
<p id="p-257">Most, if not all, of the following algorithms use the fact that we write numbers in a place-value system to break the computation into easier parts that we can put together at the end.</p>
<p id="p-258">Is there a "best" algorithm for each arithmetic operation? Depending on what you care about (speed, efficiency, ease of understanding, consistency in all cases), a different algorithm can be "better" than others. Regarding understanding, the most understandable algorithm may differ from student to student, and from teacher to teacher. So it is a very hard (and in some cases impossible) task to exclusively recommend one algorithm over another.</p>
<p id="p-259">It is important to study multiple algorithms for many reasons. Forst of all, understanding the details of an algorithm allows a teacher to explain how and why an algorithm works, as opposed to simply relying on some authoritative explanation like "follow these steps because they are the ones that work". Also, this understanding allows teachers to be able to find student's conceptual errors in arithmetic. Not only can they find mistakes, they can, along with discussions with the students, also determine the conceptual reasons behind these mistakes. Knowing the underpinnings of multiple algorithms allows a teacher to have many algorithmic tools in their toolbox. They can use their professional judgement for what is the most appropriate algorithm to use and/or teach depending on the needs of their students.</p>
<p id="p-260">Also, studying multiple algorithms allows teachers the opportunity to understand arithmetic through many lenses, thus increasing their overall understanding of the operations themselves. It is relatively commonplace for curricula to suggest that students develop their own personal algorithms for arithmetic. Studying multiple algorithms gives a future teacher practice in evaluating and interpreting the algorithms that students are indeed discovering (and perhaps inventing) themselves.</p>
<p id="p-261">Note that we will also learn how to use these algorithms to do arithmetic in other bases, as discussined in INSERT SECTION REFERENCE. Even though it may be unlikely that you will need to teach students how to do arithmetic in other bases, this will allow us to turn off our "muscle memory" of doing arithmetic in base ten, as we are so comfortable with many of these algorithms that it is incredibly difficult to this muscle memory off to think deeply about the algorithmeic underpinnings. As an added bonus, we will get to experience, in a small way, the struggles that your future students will have when learning about performing arithmetic for the first time.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec-AdditionAlgorithms"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<p id="p-263">NOTE ON USING MANIPULATIVES/PICTURES AS "TRAINING WHEELS"</p>
<p id="p-264">The vast majority of students who learn arithmetic in North America lean to add using the following algorithm. As it's so common, it usually gets named the <dfn class="terminology">standard addition algorithm</dfn>. In short, starting from the smallest place value to the largest (that is, from right to left) we add the place values of our numbers separately, and regroup (or "carry") any groups of the next largest place value (so the place value directly to the left) as we go.</p>
<p id="p-265">We can write this algorithmically (as a series of steps) as follows:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-26"><p id="p-266">Write one number below the other so that each place value is in its own column. Now begin at the rightmost column.</p></li>
<li id="li-27"><p id="p-267">Add the digits together (including any regroupings). If the sum is 10 or larger, write a 1 above the column to the left (this signifies that we regrouped 10 of the current place value to one of the place value to the left.)</p></li>
<li id="li-28"><p id="p-268">If there are no non-zero digits in any column to the left, you are done. Otherwise move to the next column to the left and go to Step 2.</p></li>

<p id="p-270">First, let's view the two numbers in terms of blocks:</p>
<p id="p-271">INSERT PIC OF THESE TWO NUMBERS AND THE STANDARD ALGORITHM TO THE SIDE</p>
<p id="p-272">First we add the ones place. Note tha we have <span class="process-math">\(7+9 = 16\)</span> ones. We can regroup ten (10) of those to make one of the next place value, that is, one ten. We write that regrouping as a 1 above, and we are still left with 6 ones, so we can write that down:</p>
<p id="p-273">INSERT PIC OF GROUPING AND THE STEPS IN THE ALGORITHM. NOTE THAT THE CARRY IS THE REGROUPED ONES</p>
<p id="p-274">We now move on to the next place; the tens. We have <span class="process-math">\(4+2+1\)</span> tens (the additional 1 being the regrouping from the last step). So we have 7 tens. Note that as we're working in our usual base ten, we do not have enough tens to regroup, so we simply write that we have 7 tens.</p>
<p id="p-275">Now let's move on to the next place; the hundreds. We have <span class="process-math">\(4+6-10\)</span> hundreds. We can group all ten of those (with 0 left over after regrouping) to make one of the next place value, that is, one thousand. As this is the final place that our numbers contain, we don't need to mark a regrouping and simply write down that we have 1 thousand and 0 hundreds.</p>
<p id="p-276">INSERT PIC OF THIS SIMILAR TO LAST TWO</p>
<p id="p-277">Thus we finally have that <span class="process-math">\(447+629=1076\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p id="p-278">If we think about this carefully, the addition algorithm above relies on the properties of associativity and commutativity in addition to place value. We are using these propertie when we add each place value separately and regroup any "carries" with the place value to the left. Let's write out what the standard addition algorithm is doing in the example above in a little more detail.</p>

<p id="p-279">We won't go into as much detail with all algorithms in this section, but note that underpinning all of the algorithms are the arithmetic properties from SECTION REFERENCE</p>
<p id="p-280">Note that the pictoral/block representation becomes difficult after thousands (as we run out of dimensions, as discussed above) but the idea behind the algorithm still applies for numbers with any place values.</p>

<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">4.1.1.3</span> <span class="title">Same Change Algorithm</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-320">Let's now discuss the <dfn class="terminology">same change</dfn> algorithm. To help us illustate the idea (any why it's useful to know) we start with an example. Let's add <span class="process-math">\(998+314\)</span> in our heads. Try doing this now.</p>
<p id="p-321">I'm sure that most people reading this book did not mentally perform the standard algorithm for this calculation. In fact, I can imagine that many people noticed that 998 was 2 smaller than 1000, so they added 2 to 1000 and, to "balance" out, they subtracted 2 from 314. Then adding <span class="process-math">\(1000+312\)</span> is very easy in your head. In fact, you can use this idea to add any two numbers.</p>
<p id="p-322">In general, we are using the fact that if <span class="process-math">\(a,b, \in \mathbb{N}_0\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(a+b = (a+c)+(b-c)\)</span> since we can use associativity and commutativity to rearrange the RHS to <span class="process-math">\(a+b+(c-c) = a+b+0 = a+b\text{.}\)</span> In fact, since this holds for *any* whole numbers <span class="process-math">\(a,b,c\)</span> we can indeed use this idea to judiciously choose the <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> in the calculation to make our computation easier.</p>
<p id="p-323">In the first example we chose <span class="process-math">\(c=2\)</span> so that our addition step in each place value was as easy as possible; adding 0 in fact does nothing. Thus, we turned our calculation into <span class="process-math">\((998+2)+(314-2) = 1000+312 = 1312.\)</span></p>
<p id="p-324">Note that this idea doesn't necessarily make the calculation easier and other than a few cases like the above, where one number is "close" to a round number, it's not very useful. However, we bring this up because there is a related algorithm for subtraction that is very useful!</p></section><section class="subsubsection" id="subsubsec-LatticeMethodAddition"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsubsection</span> <span class="codenumber">4.1.1.4</span> <span class="title">Lattice Algorithm</span>
</h4>
<p id="p-325">Another common method is the lattice algorithm. This is very similar to the partial sums algorithm except regroupings are displayed slightly differently. In this algorithm, each place value has a box divided into two diagonally; one section for the place value itself, and one for the next larger place value for the regroupings. This regrouping section looks connected to the diagonal section of the box to the left which contains the same place value. Like partial sums, each place value is then added separately to obtain the final sum. Again, let's look at our usual example:</p>

<p id="p-327">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-328">We now add each place value separately. Starting with the ones place we add <span class="process-math">\(7+9=16\)</span> ones, which we regroup into <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> ten and <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> ones. We write this in the leftmost box.</p>
<p id="p-329">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-330">We continue with the other two places similarly. Note that we do not need to regroup any tens, so we leave the hundreds section of that box blank (or we can put a <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> there). Thus are final partial sum should look like this:</p>

<section class="introduction" id="introduction-7"><p id="p-341">In the previous subsection we talked about different algorithms for adding. In some sense, all of the algorithms we talked about were the same, or at least very similar. It turns out that common subtraction algorithms actually differ from each other quite a bit.</p>
<p id="p-342">First, we'll talk about the "standard" algorithm that you most likely learned when doing subtraction, and explain why it works the way it does. Then we'll discuss some more (once very common) algorithms for subtraction that rely on the property that addition is the opposite operation of subtraction. Finally, we will study a partial difference algorithm, much like the partial sum algorithm above.</p>
<p id="p-343">We'll need some notation to easily talk about subtraction. In the subtraction problem <span class="process-math">\(a-b=c\)</span> we will call <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> the <dfn class="terminology">top number</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">botto, number</dfn>, respectively, and we call <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> the <dfn class="terminology">difference</dfn>.  Note that some (mostly antiquated) sources call the top number the subtrahend and the bottom number the minuend. We will avoid this archaic language, as it's rarely seen or used.</p>

<p id="p-345">The idea behind the standard subtraction algorithm is that you subtract place-by-place from right to left, that is smallest to largest place value, and if you are unable to subtract that particular place, "ungrouping" or "borrowing"  one of the places to the left and including those to the right.</p>
<p id="p-346">Like the standard addition algorithm, let's list the steps for this algorithm too. Note that this is quite complicated compared to addition.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-44"><p id="p-347">Write one number below the other so that each place value is in its own column. Now begin at the rightmost column.</p></li>
<li id="li-45"><p id="p-derived-li-45"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li id="li-46"><p id="p-348">If the top digit (or digit plus regrouping) is larger than or equal to the bottom digit, subtract and put the difference below in the same column.</p></li>
<li id="li-47"><p id="p-349">If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, determine the first digit in the top number to the left of the current place that is non-zero. Decrease that place by 1, (if there are any) change the 0 digits between that digit and our current place to 9s (or whatever the largest digit in your base is, if you are subtracting in a non-ten base), and add 10 to the current top digit.</p></li>
</ol></p></li>
<li id="li-48"><p id="p-350">If there are no non-zero digits in any column to the left, you are done. Otherwise move to the next column to the left and go to Step 2.</p></li>

<p id="p-353">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-354">Now let's subtract the rightmost place. Note that the top 2 is smaller than the bottom digit, so we must borrow. The the place directly to the left has a non-zero top digit, so we regroup 1 of this place (tens) to make 10 of our current place (ones) and thus decrease the digit in that place by 1.

<p id="p-356">Now we move to the next place to the left; the tens place. Note that the top digit is now a 4, so it is smaller than the bottom digit 5. So again, we must borrow.</p>
<p id="p-357">We have a zero immediately to the left of the (what was a 5 but is now a) 4, so we move to the left one more time (to the thousands place) since there is a non-zer digit in the top number there. We borrow one thousand, thus decreasing the thousands digit by 1, and ungroup that into 9 hundreds and 10 tens. In our calculation, this means changing the zero in the hundreds place in the top number to a 9, and the 4 in the tens place to a 14.</p>
<p id="p-358">INSERT PIC OF THIS</p>
<p id="p-359">Now we have 14 tens and we do the subtraction in the tens column <span class="process-math">\(14-5=9\)</span> .

<p id="p-364">INSERT PIC OF THE STANDARD SETUP AND BLOCKS REPRESENTING THE SITUATION</p>
<p id="p-365">We start from the ones digit on the right. Since the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, we must borrow.

<p id="p-397">We will call a digit <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> the <dfn class="terminology">same-change opposite digit</dfn>  of another digit <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(d+e=10\text{.}\)</span> We will shorten this to <dfn class="terminology">opposite digit</dfn> if there would be no confusion. For example, the opposite digit of <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(8+2=10\text{.}\)</span> Also note that <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> is its own opposite digit, since <span class="process-math">\(5+5=10\text{.}\)</span> Note that this definition is applicable for other bases beside base ten too!</p>
<p id="p-398">The algorithm is as follows.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-56"><p id="p-399">Write the subtraction vertically (as usual) with place values aligned in columns. Start at the rightmost column.</p></li>
<li id="li-57"><p id="p-400">If the top digit in this place is less than the bottom digit, add the opposite digit number of places of the bottom digit to both numbers to make a new equivalent subtraction problem (this makes the bottom digit a 0, for easy subtraction). If the top digit in this place is not less than the bottom digit, do nothing.</p></li>
<li id="li-58"><p id="p-401">If there are non-zero digits in any place to the left of this place, move to the left one place and go to step 2. Otherwise, go to the next step.</p></li>
<li id="li-59"><p id="p-402">Each top digit should be greater than or equal to the bottom digit in its respective place. Subtract the digits in each place to obtain your final answer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-403">This sounds more complicated than it actually is, so we will show an example to see this algorithm in action.</p>

<p id="p-413">This algorithm is, in some sense, a combination between the standard subtraction algorithm and the same change algorithm. This is a "borrowing" algorithm, though instead of borrowing from the place to the left in the top number, we are "in debt" to the place to the left in the bottom number. Let's write down the algorithm and then do our usual example.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-60"><p id="p-414">Write the subtraction vertically (as usual) with place values aligned in columns. Start at the rightmost column.</p></li>
<li id="li-61"><p id="p-415">If the digit in the top number is less than the digit in the bottom number (including additional ones if one is there), add ten of that place to the top digit (signified by a 1) while adding an additional 1 to the place to the left in the bottom number. Then subtract the bottom number from the top number in that place. If the digit in the top number is greater than the digit in the bottom number, do the place subtraction without any borrowing.</p></li>
<li id="li-62"><p id="p-416">If there are any non-zero digits in any places to the left of the current place, move one place to the left and go to step 2. Otherwise you are finished.</p></li>

As usual we line up our numbers so digits of the same place value are in the same column, but this time we will have just a little bit of space between the bottom number and our difference (for any borrowed 1's that will appear). And, as usual, we will include blocks for added pictoral understanding.</p>
<p id="p-418">INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-419">Starting with the ones place, we see that the digit <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in the top number is less than the digit <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> in the bottom. So we "borrow" 10 ones, but unlike the standard subtraction algorithm we are "in debt" 1 ten to the bottom number. Thus, we have <span class="process-math">\((10+2)-7=12-7=5\)</span> ones in our difference. We mark this, and our additional debt of 1 ten, in our calculation:</p>
<p id="p-420">INSERT PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-421">Now we move to the tens place. We see that the <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> in the top number is less than the <span class="process-math">\(5+1\)</span> in the bottom number, so we "borrow" 10 tens from 1 hundred in the same way as the previous step to have <span class="process-math">\((10+5)-(5+1)=15-6=9\)</span> tens in our difference.  We mark this, and our additional debt of 1 hundred, in our calculation:</p>
<p id="p-422">INCLUDE PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-423">Now we move to the hundreds place. We see that the <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> in the top number is less than the <span class="process-math">\(4+1\)</span> in the bottom number, so we "borrow" 10 hundreds from 1 thousand in the same way as our previous two steps to have <span class="process-math">\((10+0)-(4+1)=10-5=5\)</span> hundreds in our difference. We mark this, and our additional debt of 1 thousand, in our calculation:</p>
<p id="p-424">INCLUDE PIC HERE</p>
<p id="p-425">Finally we move to the thousands place.

As there are no more non-zero digits to the left (that is; no larger places than thousands in our numbers,) we are finished, and we have calculated <span class="process-math">\(4052-2457=1595.\)</span></p>
